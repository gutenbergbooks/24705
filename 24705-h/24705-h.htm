plunge head-long into an abyss of vain glory, hoping at life&rsquo;s

suggest that you pause first to read the story of &ldquo;The Woman With
a Stone Heart,&rdquo; Marie Sampalit, dare-devil of the
Philippines.</p>

our train of soldier boys started to war; who later, while I was Ten
Thousand miles away from home on soldier duty in the Philippine
Islands, became a Mother; and who, unfortunately, three months
thereafter, was called upon to lay our first-born, Oliver D. Coursey,
into his snow-lined baby tomb amid the bleak silence of a cold
winter&rsquo;s night, with no strong arm to bear her up in those awful

<p class="first">Marie Sampalit and her fiancee, Rolando Dimiguez, were
walking arm-in-arm along the sandy beach of Manila bay, just opposite
old Fort Malate, talking of their wedding day which had been postponed
because of the Filipino insurrection which was in progress.</p>
<p>The tide was out. A long waved line of sea-shells and drift-wood
marked the place to which it had risen the last time before it began to
recede. They were unconsciously following this line of ocean debris.
Occasionally Marie would stop to pick up a spotted shell which was more
pretty than the rest. Finally, when they had gotten as far north as the
semi-circular drive-way which extends around the southern and eastern
sides of the walled-city, or Old Manila, as it is called, and had begun
to veer toward it, Marie looked back and repeated a beautiful memory
gem taught to her by a good friar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12"
href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>when she was a pupil in one of
the parochial schools of Manila:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;E&rsquo;en as the rise of the tide is told,</p>
<p class="line xd20e191">By drift-wood on the beach,</p>
<p class="line">So can our pen mark on the page</p>
<p class="line xd20e191">How high our thoughts can reach.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">They turned directly east until they reached the low
stone-wall that prevents Manila bay from overflowing the city during
the periods of high tides. Dimiguez helped Marie to step upon it; then
they strolled eastward past the large stake which marked the place
where the Spaniards had shot Dr. Jose Rizal, the brainiest patriot ever
produced by the Malay race.</p>
<p>When they came to the spot, Marie stopped and told Dimiguez how she
had watched the shooting when it took place, and how bravely Rizal had
met his fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for this outrage committed by the
Spaniards,&rdquo; remarked Dimiguez, &ldquo;this insurrection would not
have lasted these two years, and we would have been married before now;
but our people are determined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>to seek revenge for his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they started on, changed their course to the northward, entered
the walled-city by the south gate, walked past the old Spanish arsenal,
and then passed out of the walled-city by the north gate. Here they
crossed the Pasig river on the old &ldquo;Bridge of Spain&rdquo; (the
large stone bridge near the mouth of the river, built over 300 years
ago) and entered the Escolta, the main business street of Manila. After
making their way slowly up the Escolta they meandered along San Miguel
street until they finally turned and walked a short distance down a
side street to a typical native shack, built of bamboo and thatched
with Nipa palms, happily tucked away beneath the overhanging limbs of a
large mango tree in a spacious yard,&mdash;the home of the
Sampalits.</p>
<p>Here Marie had been born just seventeen years before; in fact the
next day, April 7, would be her seventeenth birthday. When she was
born, her father instituted one of the accustomed Filipino dances which
last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>from three to five days and nights, and at its
conclusion she had been christened &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; subsequently
changed by force of habit to &ldquo;Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that evening, while they were seated side-by-side on a bamboo
bench beside of her home, tapping the toes of their wooden-soled
slippers on the hard ground, and indulging in a wandering lovers&rsquo;
conversation, Marie said to him (calling him affectionately by his
first name), &ldquo;Rolando, when did you first decide to postpone our
wedding day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how it was,&rdquo; answered he,
meditatingly. &ldquo;The thought of serving my country had been
lingering on my mind all last summer&mdash;in fact, ever since the
insurrection first broke out in the spring of 1896. You know I intended
coming down to see you last Christmas, but I couldn&rsquo;t get away.
That night I walked the floor all night in our home at Malolos,
debating in my mind whether we had better get married in March, as we
had planned, or if it would not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>be wiser and more manly for me
to go to war, take chances on getting back alive and postpone our
wedding day until after the war is over. Toward morning, I decided that
it was my duty to become a soldier; so I called my father and mother,
got an early breakfast, bade them goodby and started for Malabon, which
was Aguinaldo&rsquo;s headquarters, and enlisted. He was glad to see
me. You know, he and I attended school together for one year at
Hongkong. Well, Aguinaldo at once commissioned me a spy and assigned me
to very important duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; interrupted Marie, &ldquo;you are not on that
duty now, are you, Rolando?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dimiguez arose. &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said he firmly, &ldquo;I must
be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you tell me where you are going and what task
lies before you?&rdquo; pleaded Marie, as she threw both arms about his
neck and began to sob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell a living soul, so
help me God, but I must know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spy never tells his plans to anyone, Marie,&rdquo; said
Dimiguez slowly. &ldquo;He takes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>his orders from his chief, plays
his part; and if he gets caught, he refuses to speak and dies without a
murmur, like a man. Good night, Marie, I must be off; duty lies before
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie cried herself to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning she started down town, as usual, for the market
place, with her bamboo basket filled with bananas, sitting on her head,
and a cigarette in her mouth. She had only gone a block when she met a
neighbor girl, one of her chums of equal years to her own, who was a
chamber-maid in the German consul&rsquo;s home on San Miguel
Street.</p>
<p>Her friend looked excited. &ldquo;Have you heard the awful news,
Marie?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Marie, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dimiguez was caught last night by Spanish guards inside
the yard of the governor-general&rsquo;s summer palace up on the
Malacanan, just as he was slipping out of the palace itself. How he got
in there, nobody knows.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>Marie dropped her basket. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; gasped she,
&ldquo;Did he do anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found in his pocket diagrams of the interior of the
palace, showing the entries to it, the room where the governor-general
sleeps, and many other things; also your picture. See here! the morning
paper gives a full account of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie glanced at the head lines and then started on a vigorous run
for the building in which the Spanish military court was sitting.
Rushing in, past an armed guard, she began to plead for her
lover&rsquo;s life. But he had already been tried, convicted and
sentenced to death by strangulation in the old chute at Cavite.
Dimiguez never moved a muscle when he saw Marie. Armed guards forced
her abruptly out of the building and ordered her to leave.</p>
<p>Inside of two hours, on the same day, April 7, the anniversary of
Marie&rsquo;s birth, he was taken to the little town of Cavite, seven
miles southwest of Manila, and was there placed in the lower end of a
long chute built <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>out into Manila Bay. This chute was just wide
enough for a man to enter. Its sides, top and bottom were all built of
heavy planks. The side planks lacked a few inches of connecting with
the top, although of course the side posts ran clear up and the top was
firmly bolted to them. The entrance to it was well elevated near the
docks. The lower end protruded into the bay, so that it was visible
about eighteen inches above the water during the period of low tide,
and submerged several feet during high tide.</p>
<p>Tides come in slowly at Cavite, each succeeding wave rising but a
trifle higher than the others, until the usual height is reached. Thus,
a prisoner placed in this chute, forced to the lower end and then
fastened securely during low tide, can look out over the side planks at
the hideous spectators, watch the tide as it begins to rise and see
slow death approaching. It was in this chute that Marie&rsquo;s lover
met his death.</p>
<p>Marie saw the launch that carried him away as it left Manila. She
rushed down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>to the Pasig river, loosened her little boat from
the tree to which it was tied, jumped in, seized the oars and started
in pursuit. The launch on which he was being carried had for its power
a gasoline engine, and, of course, it soon left her far behind. When
she first started, the swells caused by the launch rocked her little
canoe quite roughly and impeded her progress. As she approached the
mouth of the river, passed the monument of Magellan and came between
the walled-city on the southern bank and the docks on the northern
bank, a crowd of excited natives thronged the shore, and many of them
recognized her. She heard some one cry out, &ldquo;Vive Marie!&rdquo;
With might and main she strove forward.</p>
<p>The launch made its seven-mile run to Cavite; the victim was placed
in the chute; the tide had risen to the danger line; her lover, with
his head thrown back, had just begun to gurgle the salt water, when
Marie, in frantic agony, almost exhausted, rowed around the lower end
of the chute and came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>near enough to the dying hero to be
recognized by him. Straining ever muscle to keep his head above the
water a second longer, he cried out in chocking tones that were
interrupted by the merciless sea which was rapidly filling his mouth,
&ldquo;Goodby, Marie, God bless you. Avenge my death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hush! At this moment another tidal wave engulfed the apex of the
chute. Not a sound could be heard save the slight flapping of the waves
against the pier, and the dismal chant of three priests, who stood on
the shore near by, and who had not been permitted to attend the young
spy before his death. Marie trembled; she dropped the oars; her eyes
fell; for a moment it seemed that her young heart stood still: then her
face flushed; the tears stopped flowing; anguish gave vent to
determined revenge; pent-up sorrows yielded to out-spoken threats; and
in tones sufficiently audible to be heard ashore, she cried,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spaniard knows no pity. If Marie were to have stepped ashore
immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>after her lover&rsquo;s strangulation, she might
have come to grief. It is strange that she escaped punishment for
having followed. She, therefore, rowed directly east and landed on the
beach of the bay, about four miles south of Manila, just west of the
little city of Paranaque.</p>
<p>From sheer exhaustion, she needed food; therefore, she walked
northward along the shore until she found a Mango tree heavily laden
with fruit. After eating a few luscious mangoes, she crept into a clump
of bamboo and had a good cry: tears so ease a woman&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>From her position on the beach she could readily see the Spaniards
as they took her dead lover from the chute when the tide had lowered
toward evening. She saw them even strike his corpse, and she bit her
finger nails as she watched them place him in a rough wooden box and
haul him up through the streets of the village on an old two-wheeled
cart drawn by a caribou.</p>
<p>With the approach of sunset, things <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>grew strangely quiet. The
spring zephyr that had blown modestly during the day died away. There
was no longer even a dimple in the blue surface of Manila Bay. Not a
leaf was astir. It seemed to Marie that the only sound she could hear
was the the throbbing of her own heart. To her the whole world seemed
like an open sepulcher. Looking down she discovered that she was
unconsciously sitting on a flowery terrace and that all about her was
life. She pulled one of those exquisite white flowers with wide pink
veins, peculiar alone to the Philippines, and pressed it to her
lips.</p>
<p>The sun was just setting beyond Corregidor. The island&rsquo;s long
shadows seemed to extend completely across the bay to her feet. As the
solar fires burned themselves out, the orange tint which they left
behind against the reddened sky reminded Marie of the night before,
when she and her lover had strolled along the shore of the bay about
three miles farther north; and as the sun slowly nodded its evening
farewell and buried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>its face in the pillow of night, she
remembered how he, on the previous night, had called to her attention
the lingering glow of its fading beams. Before her lay the Spanish
fleet, it, too, casting shadows that first grew longer and longer and
then dimmer and dimmer until they in turn had died away in the spectral
phenomenon of night.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s thoughts turned toward home. What about her mother?
She walked back to her little boat, pushed it out into the bay, and,
stepping into it, sat down, took hold of the oars and started northward
near the beach. Just opposite Fort Malate, she swung westward, and,
passing outside of the break-water a mile from shore, she entered the
Pasig river and hurried homeward. When she arrived, about nine
o&rsquo;clock, she found her mother on the verge of prostration; for
that very day, strange to say, Marie&rsquo;s father, who was a colonel
in the Filipino infantry, had been killed at San Francisco del Monte,
six miles north-east of Manila, in a battle with Spanish troops.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, mother,&rdquo; expostulated Marie,
&ldquo;from now on I intend to kill every foe of ours in these
islands!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Three weeks passed by. Marie had gone down town late
in April to do some shopping. While she was standing in the door of the
old postoffice on the Escolta, she heard the shrill voice of a Filipino
lad piping out: &ldquo;Papers! Papers! All about the war with the
United States. Dewey&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; He had a bundle of
newspapers under his right arm and was waving one in his left hand.
Everybody rushed out of the bazaars and offices along the Escolta where
they were transacting their business, and each one who could get near
enough to the boy, eagerly bought a morning paper.</p>
<p>The lad&rsquo;s papers were all gone but one. Marie Sampalit
snatched it from his hands, and dropped into one of them a small coin.
She stepped into the corridor of the post office, to escape the
annoyance of the crowd, and read the large head lines: <span class=

<hr class="tb">

Loss of Life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;m off for Corregidor Island right away!&rdquo;
exclaimed Marie. &ldquo;Dewey can&rsquo;t get into the Bay except by
that route. That&rsquo;s where the fight will begin. Mother
doesn&rsquo;t know this. I&rsquo;ll tell her I am going to take some
supplies to the Spanish garrison. I will go at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Region Around Manila Bay</p>
</div>
<p>She set out from Manila in a small casco, or flat-bottomed native
boat, heavily laden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span>with fresh fish, pine-apples, mangoes,
bananas, tobacco and cigarettes&mdash;all intended for the Spanish
garrison on Corregidor Island. Manila is situated on the eastern shore
of Manila Bay. From there to the island it is nearly thirty miles. Her
little boat was driven forward on its journey by an easterly wind that
gently swelled the tiny sails.</p>
<p>She reached the island at five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon and was
given a royal welcome by the Spanish soldiers. Marie gave them the
morning paper containing the news of Dewey&rsquo;s prospective arrival.
She asked permission to take part in the fight.</p>
<p>Marie was a favorite with the Spanish garrison. Her genial
disposition, added to her almost inconceivable daring, had won for her
the friendship and admiration of all. The gunners had playfully taught
her all about loading, firing and swabbing their cannon. She had also
learned the art of good marksmanship, so that at a target practice she
was an adept.</p>
<p>Impatiently she awaited the arrival of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>the American fleet. She
heard the Spaniards discuss among themselves the cowardice of the
American soldiers, and saw them wager the Dewey would not come to
Manila at all but that he would sail down around the Malay Peninsula
and hasten home by way of Good Hope to save his vessels from certain
destruction. All this sounded plausible to her and she grew restless
and enthusiastic as the dull hours dragged away.</p>
<p>Dewey was so long in coming from Hongkong and the garrison on the
island had been kept at their guns ready for action for so many hours
without rest that many of them were completely tired out by the last
day of April, and asked for relief. It was hard to give it.
Marie&rsquo;s opportunity had come. Her ability as an expert rifle shot
was known alike to officers and enlisted men. She offered to serve. The
Spanish commandant could not well refuse. He needed her services;
besides, the Spaniards were just then doing all within their power to
win the temporary friendship of the natives. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>Consequently, he promised to assign her to duty
for the night.</p>
<p>The sunset, as viewed from Corregidor Island on the evening of April
30, was most glorious. Not a cloud was in the sky; a dead calm
prevailed, so that the sea was unusually smooth. As the sun sank to
rest behind the shimmering horizon it caused the island to cast a long
shadow over Manila bay as far as the eye could reach, but this soon
disappeared.</p>
<p>When the sun had sunk from view, Marie noticed that a comparatively
new moon was visible in the sky, and she remarked to the Sergeant of
the Guard, &ldquo;It will not be very dark to-night. We can see the
Americanos a long way off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, &ldquo;the only difficulty
with the cowards is that they will not come near enough to be seen at
all. They have had plenty of time to run from Hongkong to Manila and
back <span class="corr" id="xd20e553" title=
"Source: agin">again</span>; still they have not been seen or heard of.
I&rsquo;ll bet you a peso (Spanish dollar) that they have gone home
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>and that all of this excitement has been for
nothing. Dewey is getting old, Marie; he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to a
watery grave so far from home. If he were young and ambitious, it would
be different. Old men do not care much about real fighting, especially
on the sea. It is different with old generals commanding land forces.
They can sit away back in the rear of the battle-field, receive
messages that come to them; plan certain movements based upon these
reports; and while they do have considerable responsibility, still they
are not in the actual fight. As for Dewey, nobody has ever heard of
him. He is not a recognized naval commander. Besides, the old fellow,
according to reports, is slow and easy going. If he should come to make
us an unfriendly call tonight, mark my word, Marie, there will not be a
sliver of his entire fleet left floating above the water yonder inside
of thirty minutes after the first shot is fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely concluded speaking when the Officer of the Guard,
Lieutenant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>Orlando, called out, &ldquo;Sergeant of the Guard!
Fall in the First Relief!&rdquo; The Sergeant threw his arm over
Marie&rsquo;s shoulder in an affectionate manner, smacked a hurried
caress against her olive cheek, jumped up from the little bamboo bench
on which they were sitting, rushed up to the guard house and cried out,
&ldquo;First Relief! Fall in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie hastened after him. As the relief was forming in line, she
seized a Mauser rifle that stood leaning against a huge rock, grabbed
up a cartridge belt well filled with Mauser ammunition that was lying
on the ground near by, hastily adjusted it to fit her waist measure,
buckled it on and fell into the rear rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count fours!&rdquo; ordered the Sergeant. As is usual in
military affairs, the front and rear rank men count in unison; that is,
number one in the front rank and number one in the rear rank both count
&ldquo;one&rdquo; at the same time; second file counts
&ldquo;two,&rdquo; etc. When it came to Marie she piped out
simultaneously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>with the corporal who stood in front of her,
&ldquo;quatro.&rdquo; (four).</p>
<p>As the guard was marched along the stony pathways on Corregidor
Island and the various sentinels were relieved, Marie soon saw that
there was not going to be a place for her. She tip-toed up to the
corporal who was posting the relief and asked him where he was going to
station her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the corporal, &ldquo;we have a place
for you.&rdquo; And sure enough, they had.</p>
<p>Every soldier or civilian who has ever been on this island will
readily recall the rough, hard-beaten, winding path that led from the
summit of the hill, in a south-westerly direction, down over
precipices, around clumps of bamboo, to a beautiful fresh water spring
which bubbled out of the coral rocks at a point just high enough to
prevent it from being inundated or even infiltrated during the season
of high tides.</p>
<p>A few feet from this spring and elevated but slightly above it, is a
massive, flat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>rock. Along the north and west sides of this rock
is a vertical stone precipice some eight feet high, which from its
upper edge inclines back gradually at an angle of about twenty degrees
above a horizontal plane, toward the crest of the island.</p>
<p>On this rock Spain firmly bolted one of her most modern
cannon&mdash;a good seven-inch gun. It was so situated on a revolving
casement that its shots could be made to sweep the whole Boca Grande
channel, as the large entrance south of the island is called. Marie had
often operated this gun. She had done splendid work with it on a
floating target two miles distant. Its deadly roar was her delight. Oh!
if she could but use it just once on an actual enemy instead of firing
it at an indicated one!</p>
<p>When the old guard had been relieved and the sentries were marched
back to the guard-house to be dismissed, poor Marie, heavy hearted,
marched along. Just as they approached the guard-house, the sergeant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>motioned to her to fall out and to come toward
him. This she did.</p>
<p>Into her ear he whispered the information that was to start her on
her eventful military career. &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
officer of the Guard informs me that we cannot use you in the infantry
service tonight, but that you will be needed with the
artillery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Marie, &ldquo;Where shall I
serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the new gun on the large rock near the spring,&rdquo;
answered the Sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;Dewey will surely
come, and when I put a solid shot through the &rsquo;Olympia&rsquo;
just below the water line&mdash;the battle will be half over. Oh!
I&rsquo;m so anxious! May I go down there tonight and take charge of
the gun at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sergeant told her to report to the headquarters of the artillery
department where she would receive instructions.</p>
<p>At last she found herself on actual duty. How her young heart
throbbed as her black eyes peered forth into the darkness. Toward
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>midnight, small clouds began to drift oceanward.
For a few moments at a time they would obscure the quartered cheek of
the young moon. Oh! if Dewey would but come. The hopes of a life-time
were poised on that painful &ldquo;if.&rdquo; Before her was the dream
of glory; behind her, the dreary forgetfulness of the past. Hour after
hour whiled away. The tiny lights in the natives&rsquo; shacks along
the opposite shore began to go out and grow fewer and fewer until the
closing day had died safely away into the solemn night. As usual,
&ldquo;taps&rdquo; were blown at ten o&rsquo;clock and things on the
island grew very quiet. Days&mdash;yes, weeks&mdash;seemed to crowd
themselves into those long hours. Would he ever come?</p>
<p>Presently she heard the sentry&rsquo;s shrill cry on the brow of the
hill, &ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock! All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; The echo of
his repeated call had scarcely died away when Marie thought she saw
something dark on the water near the center of the channel, perhaps
three miles away. She whispered to a member of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>artillery corps, who sat near her watching the
shadow of his pipe on the rock near the base of the cannon. They both
looked. Surely! it&rsquo;s Dewey! The artilleryman sent up a rocket as
a warning. Marie took hurried aim. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; went her cannon,
and from its mouth a seven-inch shot was hurled over the
&ldquo;Concord,&rdquo; between its main and mizzen masts. It went a
trifle high and did no harm.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Hero of Manila Bay</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went one of the port batteries on the
&ldquo;Raleigh&rdquo; and before its flash was gone a shudder shot
through every vein, every nerve and every fiber of Marie&rsquo;s body.
Such a crash she had never heard before. &ldquo;War is hell&rdquo; to
be sure. She sniffed the smoke from her own gun, and looked around to
see what had happened. The stone precipice behind her was torn into
fragments. A man&rsquo;s hand protruded from the debris. &ldquo;My
God!&rdquo; she murmured. Yes, there was the evidence. The man who had
sat by her side and who sent up the rocket, lay cold in death. His head
was torn off and his body <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>was mangled among the pieces of
broken rock. The gunner on the &ldquo;Raleigh&rdquo; had done his work
well; and Marie&rsquo;s dream of American cowardice, of their poor
marksmanship and of her ability to sink Dewey&rsquo;s flag ship, were
shattered in an instant. She had fired the FIRST gun of the war, but
not the LAST! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After Dewey&rsquo;s fleet had passed the island and
entered the bay, proper, Marie crept up to the top of the cliff and
awaited the results. As she sat there shivering with fright, day began
to dawn. Presently she heard the Spanish batteries on Point Cavite fire
a heavy shot&mdash;then a second one; and a few minutes later she saw
flames of fire and smoke belching forth from the starboard sides of
Dewey&rsquo;s entire squadron. Then the Spanish fleet, lying off of
Point Cavite, commenced a united and simultaneous action.</p>
<p>Shells rent the air; the men on both fleets cheered as they beheld
the effect on the enemy of a well-directed shot; smoke-begrimed
gunners, with the perspiration washing light-colored furrows down their
manly cheeks, stood at their guns and worked like demons as they
swabbed their cannon and crowded into them shot after shot. Hissing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>projectiles that missed the opposing ships and
plunged into the bay, were throwing volumes of splashing foam into the
air. Dewey&rsquo;s vessels were moving in a figure eight and using
alternately the several guns on their port and on their starboard
sides, while the Spanish ships moved about promiscuously among each
other in an awkward fashion, over a small area, and fired only as an
opportunity offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;m out of range of the demons,&rdquo; said
Marie to a Spanish officer who had come to her side.</p>
<p>Just then, there was a lull in the battle. Dewey&rsquo;s ships
ceased firing and withdrew to the middle of the bay. No apparent damage
had been sustained by the vessels of either command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old fellow is going to quit,&rdquo; said Marie to the
Spanish officer who stood erect with his field glasses carefully
trained on Dewey&rsquo;s squadron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming this way, Marie,&rdquo; said the
officer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! where will we go, if they come past the island and
open fire on us again?&rdquo; shouted Marie. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a
mounted gun left to shoot with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer remained quiet. Presently he said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
stopped and are dividing up their ammunition. Evidently they are going
to resume the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He guessed it right. In thirty minutes Dewey&rsquo;s vessels were
heading straight for the Spanish fleet. His first shot set on fire the
beautiful Spanish flag-ship, the &ldquo;Reina Christina.&rdquo; Then
her magazine blew up. She was hastily scuttled on the beach near Cavite
and deserted amid great disorder by that portion of her crew which was
able to leave. The dead and the dying were left to their fate.
Magazines in several other Spanish ships soon blew up. In a few minutes
most of them were on fire. Dewey&rsquo;s gunners were doing deadly
execution. Hundreds of Spanish soldiers could be seen jumping from
their burning vessels into the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what is he going to do?&rdquo; said Marie, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>with
some excitement, as she saw one of Dewey&rsquo;s ships, the
&ldquo;Concord,&rdquo; disengage herself from the rest of the fleet and
head straight for a large Spanish gun-boat that was lying off to
herself and whose sole business it seemed was to keep up a deadly fire
on Dewey&rsquo;s flagship, the &ldquo;Olympia.&rdquo; The Concord
literally disembowled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heartless wretches!&rdquo; exclaimed Marie, as she
watched another American ship, the &ldquo;Petrel,&rdquo; leave the line
of battle and make a rapid run right past the Spanish fleet for the
village of Cavite. &ldquo;I wonder what the villains are up to
now.&rdquo; In a few minutes the Petrel returned, with six small
vessels in tow as prizes. In addition, she was flying at her mast head
this signal, &ldquo;Have destroyed eight vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dewey&rsquo;s ships moved over toward the city of Manila, took their
positions in line and remained quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; asked Marie of the Spanish officer
who stood near her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve-thirty,&rdquo; answered he, as he looked at his
watch.</p>
<p>Marie whiled away the afternoon watching the Spaniards on Corregidor
island burying their dead comrades. She wanted to go home, but she
feared to go past Dewey&rsquo;s fleet.</p>
<p>That evening things became solemnly quiet; and the blazing sun, as
its face reddened into nightly slumber beyond the watery horizon of the
Pacific, bade farewell to a finished deed, which, in the history of
naval warfare, has never been surpassed; while the pale-faced moon,
moving slowly up her appointed path, looked calmly down with her
quartered cheek in silent benediction on the blazing hulls of the
Spanish ships as they slowly cremated their dead and dying.</p>
<p>The next day the Spanish Commandante on Corregidor discovered that
Dewey had blockaded the port of Manila, so he restrained Marie from
starting home for nearly a week.</p>
<p>Finally, she got permission to go. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>she passed Dewey&rsquo;s
fleet she was surprised to find everything so peaceful and to see
dozens of native canoes hovering along the port-holes of his vessels,
selling fruit and curios to his men.</p>
<p>Marie reached home in the early evening, and found her old mother
frantic because of her absence and the excitement that had taken
place.</p>
<p>During the next few weeks while Dewey was waiting for reinforcements
from home, many strange things occurred on shore. The Filipinos
captured or killed nearly all of the smaller Spanish garrisons
distributed throughout the islands. On May 26, they secretly cut down
the Spanish guards walking their beats along the western side of the
little town of Cavite, and let in a horde of Tagalos well armed with
bolos, who crept up near a large stone cathedral, built in 1643, in
which the Spaniards, as a military necessity after their defeat by
Dewey, were making their headquarters. These Filipinos made a mad rush
through the back door of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>the building and captured all the
Spaniards being quartered therein. This feat also gave them possession
of another lot of Mauser and Remington rifles and a goodly store of
ammunition, for which they had been yearning.</p>
<p>Dewey had no men whom he could spare to send ashore; therefore, he
had left these surrendered Spaniards to take care of themselves.
Evidently he did not anticipate an attack upon the garrison at Cavite,
or he might have landed enough marines from his battleships to have
prevented it.</p>
<p>When Marie heard about the capture of the Spanish garrison at Cavite
by the Filipinos, she at once rowed over there to see what was going to
be done with the prisoners. This was the first time she had been at
Cavite since the day of her lover&rsquo;s tragic death. She found the
Filipinos jubilant over their new fire-arms. But many of them had never
before used a gun and they were very awkward with them, so that
accidents were constantly occurring. The privileges of target
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>practice given to Marie by the Spaniards, in times
past, now found a new reward. She organized the Filipinos into squads
for this training, arranged suitable targets for them, supervised the
loading and cleaning of their guns, and by voluntary assent became the
leader in a whole lot of nefarious mischief in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But what about her lover&rsquo;s dying request and the vow she
registered in her aching soul as she left the scene of his death? By
remaining away from the graves of our loved ones we may check memory
and enthrone reason, thus more rapidly overcoming sorrow. By constantly
resorting to places of grief we keep that grief, whatever may have been
its cause, fresh on the tablets of our memories. The fact that Marie
had not returned to Cavite, the scene of her sorrow, for about two
months, helped her to forget it and to flirt with fate among the very
troops who had caused it. Now that she had returned to Cavite, old
visions began to haunt her. Shooting at wooden targets was not
desperate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>enough to appease her nature; she longed for
bloodshed.</p>
<p>Between herself and a few Filipino leaders she concocted a scheme
that would be hilarious, avenge the death of him whom she had briefly
mourned, as well as the deaths of Rizal and thousands of other
Filipinos who had been shot or strangled by the Spaniards, and satisfy
the longings of her innermost nature. It was this: a pit twenty feet in
diameter and ten feet deep was to be dug on the higher ground a few
miles southwest of Cavite. Each morning twenty of the captured
Spaniards were to be marched out to this pit and made to slide down a
bamboo pole into it. The Filipino soldiers, armed with their
newly-captured rifles, were then to stand around the brink of this pit
and use these half-starved Spaniards for living targets. Marie gloated
over her new enterprise. What sport! How she enjoyed it! The
Filipino&rsquo;s marksmanship was poor and many of their unfortunate
prisoners were shot over a dozen times before they were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>stilled
in death. This bloody practice was kept up until over two hundred
Spaniards had been slain.</p>
<p>About this time rumors of what was being done reached the ears of
General Anderson. He ordered it stopped, and sent food ashore, under
American escorts, for the Spanish prisoners. These prisoners, before
being led to the slaughter, were housed by the Filipinos in an
unfinished portion of the old convent at Cavite, and in some large
stone buildings without floors and with only a few windows, heavily
barricaded with iron bars, formerly used by the natives for storage
purposes for various cargoes of raw materials, preparatory to
exportation. These buildings were dark, damp and infested with a
multiplicity of insectivora.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, imprisoned therein, were fed by the Filipinos on a
very small ration of uncooked rice. This they had to pound into meal,
and eat it out of their hands. Water, although plentiful, was denied
them, except in small quantities. They had no beds, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>but
slept on the bare ground. Many of them were practically nude. They had
staid by their guns on the Spanish fleet until their ships began to
sink; then they had jumped overboard and swam ashore, taking off most
of their clothes before making the attempt. The Filipinos had little
clothing to give them and no disposition to share what they did
have.</p>
<p>These half-starved wretches, pale, lean and ghostly looking, many of
them sick with fever and other ailments, none of them with a cent of
money, were a sickening sight to the American troops whom General
Anderson sent ashore to investigate their circumstances and conditions.
Of course the healthier ones were marched out and killed first. Some of
them began to cry when the American officers, pushing the Filipino
sentries aside, poked their vigorous manly faces through the openings
of the massive doors to see who and what was on the inside; but most of
them propped themselves up on one elbow and held out the other hand for
something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>to eat. Others indicated by motions that they
wanted paper and pencils, so as to write letters home, telling their
loved ones in far-off Spain that they were still alive, and asking for
money.</p>
<p>As the Americans began to empty their haversacks and hand hard-tack
and Boston baked beans to them, some of the prisoners seized them by
the fingers and kissed the backs of their hands in grateful homage for
their kindness. A few of the more ignorant ones, who had heard so much
about the cruelty of the American soldiers, and who, upon sight of our
officers, believing the end was near, had sought a kneeling attitude
and begun to pray, gradually sank back into a reclining posture and
held out their hands for a morsel of food.</p>
<p>The Filipino guards sulked when they were displaced by the American
sentries, and some of them had to be forced from their posts of
fiendish duty at the point of the bayonet. They considered these
Spaniards as reprisals, constituting their own private <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>property, with whom they could do as they pleased
without any justifiable interference on the part of anybody. Marie
Sampalit slapped an American private who had been sent to displace a
Filipino sentry whom she had just stationed at one of the prison doors.
He promptly knocked her down with the butt of his rifle. What she said
in reply he could not understand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"

<p class="first">After avenging her lover&rsquo;s death, Marie returned
again to Manila where she remained at home until the Filipino uprising
against the American troops in the spring of 1899. During this interval
of nine months, she daily frequented the places of rendezvous of the
American troops stationed in and around Manila. She also went to the
officers&rsquo; homes in the city where their wives and children were
stopping. She did their washing, and cared for the children. Her
congeniality made her a favorite. Some of the American ladies offered
to bring her back to America with them for a house-hold servant.</p>
<p>From them she learned to speak the English language nearly as
fluently as Spanish. The American soldiers were kind and polite to her.
She made considerable money by doing washing for them. It was
noticeable that she was gradually improving the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>old
bamboo home in Manila. In a few months she had come into possession of
more money than she thought there was in the entire world. Most of it
was American gold&mdash;largely in five dollar denominations. (This is
what the United States used in paying the soldiers.) These she took to
the Spanish bank in Manila and exchanged them for Mexican silver,
which, until the United States began to issue special coins for the
Philippine islands, was the standard medium of exchange in the
archipelago.</p>
<p>Marie began to dress better. Her penia cloth gave way to Chinese
silks; her wooden hair combs to expensive ones inlaid with gold, bought
at the Spanish bazar down town. Many little comforts were bought for
her home. Still the washings kept growing larger. She and her mother
could be seen back of their shack, in the shade, pounding American
soldiers&rsquo; white uniforms on large boulders from early morning
till night.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo, who had previously sold out his country and gone to
Singapore, after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>commissioning Dimiguez, upon hearing that war was
about to begin between the United States and Spain, made his way
northward to Hongkong. After the battle of Manila Bay, Dewey despatched
the revenue cutter, &ldquo;McCulloch,&rdquo; to Hongkong to cable home
the news of his splendid victory. On her return to Manila, she
permitted Aguinaldo to come along.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Aguinaldo</p>
</div>
<p>After a brief conversation with Admiral Dewey on board the
&ldquo;Olympia,&rdquo; he went ashore at Cavite, his boyhood home,
began to organize the Filipinos into a powerful army, captured 1500
Spanish soldiers who were holding out-lying posts, and hemmed in the
city of Manila.</p>
<p>On August 13, following, Dewey and General Merritt, by a union of
their forces, captured the city of Manila which offered but slight
resistance. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s native troops rushed forward with the
Americans in the charge that was made by the land forces and they
insisted on looting the city. General Merritt refused this and ordered
them to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>withdraw beyond the city limits. This they did
after considerable wrangling. Then the Americans established out-posts
on every road and pathway leading to and from the city, completely
around the town; and they were given instructions by the commanding
officer not to allow any Filipino troops to enter the city.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo discarded his uniform one evening, completely disguised
himself as a Filipino fruit-vender, and made his way into Manila.
Naturally, he slipped around to the home of his old friends, the
Sampalits. He sat in a semi-darkened room, with all the hinged-windows
to the shack tightly closed and stroked Marie&rsquo;s soft black hair
with his left hand. As he engaged her and her mother in conversation in
subdued tones, he little thought that in so short a time Marie would be
associated with him in a series of bloody tragedies that would
revolutionize the government of the islands forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to force the
Americans to acknowledge the independence <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>of the Philippine
islands, or I shall not permit the rest of their army to land. Dewey
tells me he has sent home for reinforcements. There is no use for us to
let these troops land, if America instead of Spain is going to govern
the islands. What we want is absolute independence with myself as
president of the new Filipino Republic. If the Americans won&rsquo;t
concede this to us, let&rsquo;s fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo; declared Marie.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive the foreign devils off the islands or slay
them all. Here&rsquo;s father dead and&mdash;Dimiguez,
too&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd20e740" title=
"Source: Maries">Marie&rsquo;s</span> voice trembled&mdash;&ldquo;I
tell you it&rsquo;s too much. Let&rsquo;s kill every one of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but say Marie, we must keep quiet about all this,&rdquo;
cautioned Aguinaldo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I have in mind.
We&rsquo;ll wait about four weeks and by that time if Dewey
hasn&rsquo;t received definite instructions from Washington, and if he
won&rsquo;t give me any satisfaction, I&rsquo;m going to go to Malolos,
proclaim myself Dictator of the Philippines, appoint a cabinet and a
congress from among some of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>bright young Filipinos here in
Manila who have been educated abroad, draw up a Revolutionary form of
government, and begin to administer the affairs of these islands just
as I please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep our present army in the field, and if the
Americans do land we&rsquo;ll shut them up in Manila, so that they will
have nothing at their command but the city to regulate. This
won&rsquo;t amount to much as compared with the rest of the islands
which I will dominate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the Americans won&rsquo;t land a powerful army,
cut through your lines around Manila and drive you out of Malolos, or
capture you and your officials at that place? It seems to me I would go
farther inland&mdash;say to San Isidro,&rdquo; said Marie.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo thought a moment, then replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,
in a sense, Marie; but I have got to be on or near the railroad where I
can have easy and rapid access to Manila. Malolos is not far from here
and it is situated on the railroad. It has some very large <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>buildings in which our legislative sessions could
be held. I think it the place for the undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be on the safe side, I believe I will have our troops
erect a series of fortifications between here and there along the
railroad track, so that if the Americans do attempt to advance by that
route I can easily stop them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that would be a good scheme,&rdquo; said Marie.
&ldquo;Malolos is about twelve miles from Manila Bay; besides, the bay
is shallow in the north end, so that heavy boats could not go up there.
This will make it impossible for Dewey to shell the place with his
fleet. We&rsquo;ve got to watch out for that&mdash;no matter what we
do. My! but those American ships can shoot! Did you hear about me
shooting at &rsquo;em with that cannon on Corregidor island when they
entered the bay? I mighty near got one of their vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Aguinaldo, &ldquo;I have not heard very much
about the firing off Corregidor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>but as I came from Hongkong the
other day on the &ldquo;McCulloch&rdquo; I noticed that the Spanish
fortifications on the island had all been dismantled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! they killed a man right at my feet, the very first
shot,&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;and then one of their boats drew nearer
and fired several times more and they killed every Spaniard in the
relief guard which was near by,&mdash;seven of them in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was terribly worried about Marie,&rdquo; interrupted
her mother who had listened to the conversation with deepest interest.
&ldquo;She had been gone for a week, and I hadn&rsquo;t heard a word
from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I don&rsquo;t pity the Spaniards any for what the
Americans did to them,&rdquo; interjected Aguinaldo, with some
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; said old lady Sampalit, putting her finger
on her lips, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak too loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aguinaldo continued in a lower voice: &ldquo;They killed your
husband. They shot Rizal. They strangled Dimigeuz. They tortured to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>death several hundred of our young fellows in the
dungeons. They have left ridges of dead wherever their armies have
moved among us. I tell you they deserved all they got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sampalit and Marie had grown heavy hearted. Aguinaldo looked at
his watch. It was after ten P. M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Aguinaldo, hesitatingly, &ldquo;how I
shall be able to get back to our lines tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; said Marie, in an emphatic whisper,
&ldquo;stay over night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do!&rdquo; entreated the old lady, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be best; it would surely be the safest thing to
do,&rdquo; said Aguinaldo, in a meditating manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sleep on bamboo beds,&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;There
stands mine. You may use it tonight, and I will sleep on the floor. I
don&rsquo;t mind. Mother and I frequently lie down on the floor near
the window, when the nights are sultry.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next morning Aguinaldo arose very early, made his way to the
edge of the city and stealthily stole out threw the Americans&rsquo;
lines, never again to return to Manila until General Funston brought
him back, two years later, a captive.</p>
<p>He made his way to Malolos, a few weeks after this conversation,
declared himself &ldquo;Dictator of the Philippines,&rdquo; appointed a
Filipino congress, set up a government of his own and began to run the
general affairs in the interior of Luzon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The close of the eventful year of 1898 was near at
hand. General Otis had been made governor-general of the islands. He
had received about 15,000 troops from home. These had all been landed
and were quartered in the city of Manila.</p>
<p>Preparations had begun by the American troops for a great day of
field sports to be held on the Luneta&mdash;a beautiful narrow park
paralleling Manila bay and extending southward from the walled-city
about four miles&mdash;on New Year&rsquo;s day, 1899.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January I, as planned, the exercises were begun.
The afternoon program consisted of foot races, running high jumps,
wheelbarrow race, fat man&rsquo;s race, running broad jump, high
kicking, fancy club swinging, tumbling, shot-put, sack race, tugs of
war, five boxing contests, base ball, foot ball, and pole vaulting.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>Situated on the Luneta, about a mile south of the walled city, and
distant from Manila bay about 100 feet, is a large bandstand. This
served as headquarters for the exercises. The day was
perfect&mdash;clear, cool and calm.</p>
<p>About 2:00 P.M. over 40,000 natives, soldiers (including jack-tars
from Dewey&rsquo;s fleet, Spaniards and Americans) and foreign
residents had assembled around this bandstand to hear the Address of
Welcome and to witness the sports. When the speaker arose to deliver
the address, for which he was afterward voted, and presented with, a
medal by the Eight Army Corps, he said in part (verbatim report):</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of these committeemen who have spared no efforts to
make these Field Day Exercises a success, and this occasion one long to
be remembered by those who have assembled here this afternoon, I bid
you, one and all&mdash;officers, soldiers, sailors and civilians of
every nationality&mdash;a hearty welcome.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Again to you, the members of Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s fleet, I
feel obligated to extend a separate and special welcome; for without
your chivalrous devotion to duty last May Day, yon shell-riven wrecks
(part of unraised Spanish fleet visible above the bay) would not
bespeak the down-fall of a sister nation, and we ourselves would not
have been permitted to assemble here this afternoon. There is no braver
man on land or sea than the American marine; and on behalf of the
entire American army of occupation, I bid you a most cordial
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touching upon the question of territorial expansion, the speaker
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a war for humanity, not for conquest. But simply
because it suddenly closed and left us in possession of large tracts of
new territory, is no reason why these spoils of war should be given up.
I hold this to be true Americanism: that wherever the old flag is
established through sacrifice of American blood, whether it be on the
barren sands of the desert, at the frigid extremes of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>earth,
or on the rich and fertile islands of the sea, there is should remain
triumphant, shedding forth beams of liberty to the oppressed, shouts of
defiance to the oppressor, and furnish protection and enlightenment to
all who come beneath its streaming folds forever!&rdquo;
(applause).</p>
<p>A chubby Filipino maiden, standing near the speaker&rsquo;s stand,
and who had listened intently to every word of the address, because she
now understood the English tongue, quietly elbowed her way through the
dense crowd which was gradually becoming more compressed, until she
reached a car drawn by two Chinese ponies on the old street car line
running south from Manila to Fort Malate and back. Taking the car she
rode up town to the Escolta. Going into the postoffice, she hastily
wrote and mailed to Aguinaldo at Malolos a letter containing an account
of what was said. It follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Manila, P. I., Jan. 1, 1899.</p>
<p>My Dear General:</p>
<p>Those wretched Americans are holding some kind of exercises on the
Luneta this afternoon. I heard one of the speeches. It was awful bad.
The fellow talked loud. He swung his hands in the air and the crowd
seemed to get terribly excited over what he was saying.</p>
<p>He told about that treaty of peace, and he said no power under the
sun would haul down the American flag from over Manila.</p>
<p>It made me angry. I am going right out to the Filipino trenches to
see my Uncle (Colonel Miguel). He&rsquo;ll fix those fellows.
I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;ll haul down their flag before tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p>Goodby,</p>
<p>Marie.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The evening program on the Luneta, which followed the afternoon
exercises, was largely literary in its nature. It consisted of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>music by the California band, singing by the
famous Washington Male Quartet, fancy dancing, selected recitations,
and stump speeches. In addition, Privates Green and Martin boxed four
rounds, much to the satisfaction of the natives.</p>
<p>The program had just been completed when the Master of Ceremonies
received from the American general in charge a note telling him to
announce the conclusion of the program at once and to order all
soldiers to report immediately at their respective regimental
headquarters;&mdash;trouble had been reported at the out-posts.
Reinforcements were hastened to several of the out-post reserves, and
it appeared that the expected insurrection was at hand.</p>
<p>After the out-break by the Filipinos on New Year&rsquo;s night, it
was evident to both sides that it was only a question of a short time
when blood would be spilled in abundance. The Filipinos occupied all of
the block-houses&mdash;some seventeen in number&mdash;around the city
of Manila. This forced the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>Americans to stand in the open and do
guard duty exposed.</p>
<p>The Filipino troops were saucy. They couldn&rsquo;t understand why
men should be armed with rifles and not be permitted to shoot. They
tormented the American soldiers daily with hideous pranks. They grew
bolder, and pushed their out-posts forward until they stood within a
few feet of the American sentries.</p>
<p>Marie went out and back through the American lines at will. She
secretly kept the Filipino army thoroughly posted on the arrival of new
troops from America. Occasionally she would take the train and go up to
Malolos to see Aguinaldo. She was the best posted person in the
Philippines as to what was going on in each of the hostile armies.
Nobody suspected her. She was respected by the American troops.
Everybody came to know her.</p>
<p>Just before dusk, on the evening of February 4th, 1899, Marie and
her mother left the city of Manila, in a cariole, drawn by a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>Chinese pony which they had recently purchased.
They had in it all of their most precious household trinkets. As they
passed Colonel John M. Stotsenberg, commanding the 1st Nebraska
volunteers, stationed on McLeod&rsquo;s hill at the eastern edge of
Manila, he recognized them, and called to Marie, &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out on a little trip,&rdquo; retorted Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon will you be back?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; responded Marie. &ldquo;Mother
is getting so nervous that we thought best to go away for
awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Marie,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;do you know who
the Filipino officer is in command of all those thousands of troops
that are now assembling in the ravines between the hills along the far
side of the river valley, yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; she declared with an emphatic swing of
her head.</p>
<p>But she was lying. It was Colonel Miguel, her own uncle. She knew
about it. He had secretly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>informed her that he was preparing to
attack the city and burn it and that he was going to exterminate the
American army of occupation and all foreign residents that fell into
the hands of his mighty army. He told her that he had chosen the east
side of the city as his main point of attack, so that Dewey could not
reach his troops with the shells from his gun boats in case he tried to
assist the American army, without elevating his guns and shooting
completely over the city&mdash;a thing wholly impractical within
itself, as Dewey could not determine whether his shells would be
falling among the Filipino or the American troops. It was he who
advised her to take her mother and flee to the hills for refuge.</p>
<p>Colonel Stotsenberg then asked Marie if she knew anything about the
proposed attack on the city by her people. This, she denied also. The
colonel&rsquo;s face flushed. Pulling back the flap of his tent, he
said emphatically: &ldquo;Do you see that gun, Marie? Tell those
fellows over there when you pass their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>lines that I said they
could have trouble whenever they want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie drove on.</p>
<p>Inside the colonel&rsquo;s tent stood a large gun from the Utah
battery, mounted, loaded, ready for action; its threatening nose was
pointed directly at the line of little brown men assembled across the
valley. The Filipinos were smarting for trouble. They wanted it badly.
Wherever and whenever possible they improved every opportunity to bring
it about. The trouble came. Colonel Stotsenberg that night used the
cannon he had pointed out to Marie. A long pile of mangled forms lying
at the base of the river hills on the opposite of the valley next
morning told the results. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=

<p class="first">Marie was well equipped by instinct and experience for
a spy. The tragic nature of such work was exceptionally inviting to
her. When a chance came to undertake it, she lost no time in embracing
the opportunity.</p>
<p>After passing out through the American lines, she drove on down the
slope of the hill and crossed the San Juan River on the old stone
bridge where the fighting was begun that night by young Grayson of the
Nebraska regiment. After reaching the Filipinos&rsquo; lines she at
once reported to her uncle, Colonel Miguel, and had an extended
interview with him.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Marie, Her Mother and Two Filipino Scouts</p>
</div>
<p>Secret plans were agreed upon whereby she was to become the
colonel&rsquo;s chief scout. Two Filipino soldiers were sent to
accompany her old mother to the little town of Angono on the eastern
bank of Lake Laguna de Bay, near its northern end. A native family,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>quite familiar with the Sampalits and related to
them, lived in this village. Marie stayed with the troops in the field.
Her young brain danced at the thought of more bloodshed. She must be in
the fight.</p>
<p>Just what part Marie took in the attack made upon the Americans by
the Filipinos on the night of February 4th, and in the fighting on
February 5th, the world will never know. The two main figures in these
operations were Colonel Miguel, in command of the main portion of the
Filipino forces, and Colonel Stotsenberg, who commanded the 1st
Nebraska volunteers. Before the close of the war these men were both
shot; consequently, there is no one left to tell the story, and history
is silent on the point.</p>
<p>After the fight of February 4 and 5, the entire line of block-houses
and intrenchments circumscribing Manila, were in the hands of the
Americans. From the Pasig river on the east, around the city to the bay
on the north, this line was commanded by Major-General MacArthur; the
corresponding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>semi-circle on the south, by Major-General
Anderson.</p>
<p>During the next seven weeks, fresh troops were constantly arriving.
Each side was preparing for the long, inevitable conflict.</p>
<p>At day break, on March 25, General MacArthur, leaving Hall&rsquo;s
brigade in the trenches and placing those of Otis and Hale on the
firing line, which was over seven miles in length, made a brilliant
charge along the entire front on the Filipinos&rsquo; breastworks about
a mile and a half distant and constructed parallel to those of the
Americans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Before night he had cut the Filipino army into hopeless fragments;
had advanced his own army over nine miles; had inflicted a terrible
loss upon Aguinaldo&rsquo;s troops; had demonstrated to them the
difference between a determined American advance and an irresolute
Spanish one; and had taken up in earnest the invasion of Luzon, the
capture of the Filipinos&rsquo; temporary capital, Malolos, the
overthrow of their provisional government, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>and the
establishment of American sovereignty throughout the entire
archipelago.</p>
<p>That night, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, a nervous Filipino woman
came walking down along the American out-post reserves which, during
actual war, are usually only from 100 to 200 feet in the rear of the
sentries. She reached Company &ldquo;G&rsquo;s&rdquo; reserve of the
1st South Dakota Volunteers, where she was ordered to halt. She
refused, but acted as though she did not understand. Drawing a large
bamboo bonnet down over her face to conceal her identity, she mumbled
something apparently to herself, and walked rapidly on. In a moment she
was seized; her bonnet was torn off; her identity revealed: it was
Marie.</p>
<p>She had been counting the American out-posts and the reserves to see
if the defeated Filipinos, with the reinforcements which they had
received, would be warranted in making a night attack.</p>
<p>She boldly denied her identification; fought, scratched,
scrambled&mdash;making it necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87"
href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>to employ two privates, a
corporal and a sergeant to send her to the rear.</p>
<p>When she was taken before Major William F. Allison, commanding the
3rd battalion of the South Dakotas, who was acting as field-officer
that night, he ordered her restrained until morning. A tired private
was detailed to guard her. He gave her a rubber poncho, and insisted
that she wrap herself up in it and lie down to sleep. Although she drew
the poncho about her to keep herself warm (it grew very chilly before
morning) she refused to sleep, and made repeated efforts to escape. Her
teeth chattered and she seemed distressed&mdash;evidently through fear
of what the morning might bring to her.</p>
<p>The next day she was set free, after taking a solemn oath to return
to Manila and not take any further part in the insurrection. She
pleaded earnestly for her liberty, and voluntarily promised that after
her return to Manila she would do washing free of charge for the
American soldiers who were sick in quarters. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>After being liberated, Marie walked eastward, following an irregular
sled-road; that is, a road-way used by the Filipinos for sledding their
rice to market. This is done by means of a bamboo sled drawn over the
dry ground by a caribou. She followed this road for over two miles
until she came to the San Mateo river.</p>
<p>Although given a few hardtack by her captors at the time of her
release, she was getting hungry. As she approached the stream she
noticed an old Filipino standing near his bamboo cabin which was neatly
tucked away oh the slope of a deep ravine near by. Turning from her
pathway which had now grown somewhat indistinct she approached the old
gentleman.</p>
<p>When quite close to him she said, &ldquo;Buenos dias,&rdquo; (Good
morning in Spanish.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd20e943" title=
"Source: Magundi eropo">Magandang umaga</span>,&rdquo; (Good morning,
in Tagalo), muttered the old man.</p>
<p>After a brief conversation during which Marie told him that she had
been captured by the Americans, had been terribly misused <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>and he
had a miraculous escape, he invited her into his cabin where his aged
wife gave her something to eat. This breakfast consisted of boiled
rice, some fish which the old man had just brought from his set lines
in the San Mateo river, and some bacon which he had found along the
trail made by the American&rsquo;s pack train the day before.</p>
<p>While the old couple were outside of their home&mdash;he breaking up
some bamboo with which to re-kindle the fire, and she, cleaning the
fish&mdash;Marie ransacked the house. She stole a large diamond ring
which the old man had taken from the finger of a Spanish officer during
the previous insurrection. She opened an old mahogany chest and took
from it a rosary valued at several hundred dollars; also a gold lined
cup which the old man, himself, had stolen from a Spanish priest, and
some Spanish coins.</p>
<p>After a hearty lunch, she started on.</p>
<p>Crossing the river at the rapids, on the boulders which projected
above the water, she quickened her steps and hurried along.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>Changing her course to the southward, she started
for the northern end of Lake <span class="corr" id="xd20e959" title=
"Source: Leguna">Laguna</span> de Bay to see her mother.</p>
<p>She had not gone far through a small clump of timber when she came
upon the corpse of a Filipino soldier who had been shot in the previous
day&rsquo;s engagement,&mdash;perhaps by a stray ball. Hastily stealing
the cross which hung from a small cord about his neck, and a valueless
ring from one of his fingers, she seized his Mauser rifle and his
cartridge belt which was partly filled with ammunition, and then
resumed her journey.</p>
<p>A short distance ahead was a large opening&mdash;an old rice field
well cleared. She had scarcely begun to cross it when she heard a
noise. She turned and saw the bow-legged old man whom she had robbed,
with a machete in his hand, coming after her as fast as he could. He
had discovered that the rosary was missing, and upon looking around,
that several other things were gone; therefore he at once started in
pursuit of the fiend who had just enjoyed his hospitality. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>Marie
was not disturbed. Raising to her shoulder the rifle which she had just
found, she took deliberate aim and at the first shot laid him low in
death.</p>
<p>She reached the small native village of Angono, where her mother was
stopping, about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of March 26th.</p>
<p>The old lady was wonderfully elated to receive the new jewels which
Marie had stolen. She put on the rosary and danced about in the native
hut like a young child on Christmas morning, when it sees the gorged
stocking fastened to its bed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That night Marie had a good rest. The next morning,
fired with ambition and discontent, she lit her accustomed cigarette
and started for Manila. Instead of going overland, she went in a row
boat via the Pasig river which drains the lake into Manila bay and
which flows through the city of Manila situated at its mouth.</p>
<p>While stealthily prowling around through Manila during the next few
days, Marie accidentally discovered that plans were being carried out
by the Americans to relieve the remnant of the old Spanish garrison of
fifty men stationed at the little town of Baler, near the eastern coast
of Luzon. This garrison was of course surrendered to the American
forces with the remainder of the Spanish army on August 13, 1898, but
as all lines of communication with them had been destroyed by the
Filipinos they had never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>been officially notified of the
capitulation. Scouting parties brought in the information that they
were being besieged by a horde of blood-thirsty Filipinos which
outnumbered them ten to one, and that it was only a question of time
before all would be exterminated.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Admiral Dewey and General Otis decided that something
must be done at once to relieve them. A rescuing party was formed and
placed aboard the &ldquo;Yorktown,&rdquo; which carried them around the
southern point of Luzon and then northward to the mouth of the Baler
river.</p>
<p>Marie, nerved by the thought of a new exploit, forgot her oath not
to take up arms against the Americans again during the insurrection,
and hastily departed overland for Baler to notify the besieging
Filipinos of what was to take place, and to help them as best she could
to resist the advance of the rescuing party.</p>
<p>Although Baler is situated on the Baler river, near the eastern
coast of Luzon, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>Manila is on the west side of the island
Baler is, nevertheless, almost directly north of Manila. This is caused
by the deep indention of Manila bay, on the extreme eastern side of
which Manila is situated, and by the abrupt inclination to the westward
of the eastern coast line of Luzon directly above a point straight east
of Manila.</p>
<p>In starting on her journey Marie left Manila by a little Filipino
foot-path which enters the city in the northeastern part near the San
Sebastian church. She followed it to Block-house No. 4, which is
situated about three miles north and a trifle east of Manila. At that
point she took a road which veered off perceptibly to the east for a
short distance and which was made by the Americans&rsquo; commissary
train on the morning that the advance was begun toward Malolos, March
25, preceding.</p>
<p>She had gone but a quarter of a mile when her attention was
attracted to a board used as the head-stone for a grave only a few feet
distant from her pathway. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=

<p>It was now April 2nd, and Marie had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>ahead of her about ninety
miles overland to be made on foot or else on horse-back; and it was
necessary for her to hurry along, as the rescuing party was scheduled
to reach the mouth of Baler river April 10th, or 12th.</p>
<p>Her course led past the little shack on the bank of the San Mateo
river, where she had robbed the elderly couple who had been so kind to
her and near where she later had shot the old man when he was pursuing
her to regain possession of his stolen property.</p>
<p>She found it deserted; but in a little bamboo corral nearby she
found three Chinese ponies. Evidently they had made their escape from
the scene of battle and had drifted into this yard for refuge. There
was a small stack of rice straw just outside the corral. From this
Marie soon made a stoutly-twisted rope which she hastily arranged in
the form of a bridle. Placing it over the head of the largest pony she
mounted him and rode off.</p>
<p>She got ten miles beyond this last stopping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>place before sunset. That night she stopped at a
small inland village. As she lay down to sleep on the bamboo floor in
the hut of a Tagalo family whose acquaintance she had readily formed,
recollections of the place which she had passed during the afternoon
where she had previously robbed the old couple immediately after she
was released upon oath by the Americans, suggested to her the thought
that she was violating her oath; that she was now out in a country
where she might be betrayed at any moment by her own people, or else be
captured by a squad of American infantry or cavalry; therefore, she
decided that on the following day she would destroy her identity.</p>

</div>
<p>Upon retiring the previous night Marie coiled up for a pillow her
head of long black hair. &ldquo;I hate to give it up,&rdquo; thought
she, &ldquo;but what will the Americans do to me if they capture me
another time? Oh! well, after the war is over it will soon grow out
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, after a scanty breakfast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>of
bananas and rice, and a pineapple which Marie salted heavily before she
ate it, she went to a native barber and had her long hair cut close to
the scalp, except for a little tuft on top which she had him brush up
for a pompadour.</p>
<p>Before cutting off her hair the barber tied a piece of hemp very
tightly around it, just back of her neck. After he had detached it, he
held it in front of Marie and asked her what she wished done with it.
She took it in her own hands.</p>
<p>The barber kept on trimming her shortened hair. Marie stopped
talking and seemed to be in deep meditation.</p>
<p>Presently the barber said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie arose from the rough mahogany slab on which she had been
sitting, handed him a puesta (twenty cents, Mexican), looked out of the
window and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do:
I&rsquo;ll trade you my hair for that quilas (two-wheeled cart)
standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&rdquo;; said the barber, &ldquo;My pony is dead,
and the war has so devasted the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>country, and money has become
so scarce, that I can&rsquo;t afford to buy another one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The harness hanging on it goes with the cart,&rdquo; said
Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; exclaimed the barber, &ldquo;my wife borrowed
that, and I must return it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to whom it
belongs,&rdquo; said Marie, emphatically, &ldquo;you traded me the
cart, and everything that was in it goes with the trade. How do you
suppose I could hitch my pony into the cart without a
harness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then she pulled a bolo out from under her apron. The barber
said no more.</p>
<p>Marie hitched her pony into the cart and started on toward
Baler.</p>
<p>That day she followed a good road leading toward the mountains near
the eastern coast of Luzon. By night her pony had made twenty
miles.</p>
<p>She had already reached the foot-hills. It was impossible for her to
make head-way any longer with the cart. She would soon be across the
mountains and be in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>region to be approached by the
American relief party. What was to be done?</p>
<p>A happy thought came to Marie. She clasped her hands and muttered to
herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trade the cart for a suit of men&rsquo;s
clothes and trade the harness for a sombrero,&rdquo; (bamboo hat.)</p>
<p>Since the middle of the afternoon she had been driving parallel to a
stream that wound its way, nearby, from the mountains across the plains
to the sea. Villages along the banks were numerous. At night fall she
was still in Tagalo territory. It was her own tribe. She soon found a
place to stay over night. Her pony was turned loose in a vacant yard,
with an old bamboo fence around it, and given some young rice.</p>
<p>That evening while smoking cigarettes, and while inflaming the minds
of the villagers with startling stories about the atrocities, of the
American soldiers, Marie finally succeeded in making the trade which
she had planned during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Next morning, April 5, she rode on. Before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>her
lay sixty miles of unknown territory to be covered during the next four
days, if she were to reach Baler in time to warn the besieging
Filipinos of the contemplated attack by the Americans.</p>
<p>A half mile out from the village, Marie came to an abrupt turn in
the road. Near by was a dense cluster of banana trees. She dismounted,
and while her pony was nibbling young rice she went into the thicket
and changed her attire. Then she tied a good-sized stone up in her old
clothes and threw them into the river. As she stood on the bank
watching them sink, she saw her shadow in the water. How changed she
looked! The sombrero was such a relief in keeping the hot sun off her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll not be recognized,&rdquo; thought she.
&ldquo;How nice it is to be dressed like a man. From now on I mean to
play a man&rsquo;s part and be a full-fledged soldier.&rdquo;

<p class="first">Marie reached her destination late in the evening of
April 9th, and she at once notified the officers commanding the
Filipinos who were besieging Baler, what to expect. Knowing that with
so small a force, if the Americans undertook to relieve the Spanish
garrison, it would necessarily have to be done by way of the Baler
river&mdash;as the town of Baler where the Spanish garrison was located
is some two miles up the river from where it empties into the Pacific
ocean, and the American troops were too greatly outnumbered by the
Filipinos to make a land expedition safe,&mdash;she suggested to them
the advisability of fortifying the river at specific intervals along
either bank and of taking the precaution to cover the fortifications
with freshly-cut brush so that the Americans could not locate them for
the purpose of bombarding them in case they saw fit to load
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>some of the smaller cannon on cascoes and make
their way up the river for an attack in that way.</p>
<p>The Filipinos took her suggestions, and the entrenchments and places
for the sentries were quickly, yet very wisely, arranged. It was during
the dry season and the river was very low at the time. This made it
possible to dig ditches on the sand bars which extended far out into
the stream; and by throwing into the river the loose sand taken
therefrom, to conceal these entrenchments by strewing over them some
fresh-cut limbs and old under brush which had the appearance of having
drifted to their lodgment.</p>
<p>The Yorktown arrived off the mouth of the Baler river, April 11, as
scheduled. Ensign Stanley went ashore, under a flag of truce, where, to
his surprise, he was cordially received by the Filipino officers; but
their exceptionally good behavior and the twinkle of their eyes told
only too plainly to the ensign that something was wrong. He therefore
returned to the Yorktown without having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>accomplished anything
in particular.</p>
<p>The next morning, at four o&rsquo;clock, Lieutenant Gilmore and
sixteen brave associates left the Yorktown in a row boat, and entered
the mouth of the river. Ensign Stanley and Quartermaster Lysac were put
ashore to reconnoiter. In a few minutes daylight broke forth and those
left in the boat were discovered by the Filipino sentry who was walking
his beat along the shore. He gave the alarm. Lieutenant Gilmore and his
party could easily have pulled out to sea and gotten away, but humanity
forbade it. What would become of the two scouts who went ashore? Their
comrades in the boat could not desert them, so they rowed up the river
into the very jaws of impending danger.</p>
<p>Presently out of a concealed trench hundreds of armed Filipinos
opened a deadly fire on Gilmore and his comrades, at only fifty yards
distance. The water at this point was shallow. The boat got stuck in
the mud. There was nothing to do but to fight. In a moment Morrisy fell
dead, having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>shot through the head; Dillon followed;
then McDonald, then Nygard;&mdash;Marie was doing deadly work with her
Mauser rifle.</p>
<p>The Americans returned the fire as best they could; but what was the
use. They could see nothing to fire at, so perfectly had the Filipinos
screened their trenches; besides, the Filipinos were using smokeless
powder.</p>
<p>Four of Gilmore&rsquo;s men were already dead, two were mortally
wounded and begging their comrades to shoot them before they fell into
the hands of the Filipinos, and two more were slightly wounded. Most of
the oars had been badly shattered by the enemy&rsquo;s rifle balls. In
this moment of desperation, Ellsworth, Woodbury and Edwards jumped
overboard and tried to push the boat out to mid-stream. It was no use;
the tide was coming in and the current was so strong that they could
not compete against it.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gilmore was firing his revolver. He decided to change and
use one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>the dead men&rsquo;s rifles. As he picked it up
he noticed the lock had been struck by a Remington ball and the clip
had been jammed in. He handed it to an apprentice lad, named Venville,
to be fixed.</p>
<p>The boy had scarcely begun to examine the gun, when a bullet struck
him in the fleshy part of the neck. He had never been under fire
before. Looking up calmly, he said, &ldquo;Mr. Gilmore, I&rsquo;m
hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment another bullet struck him in the chest and came out of
his arm pit. With his attention <span class="corr" id="xd20e1135"
title="Source: rivited">riveted</span> on his task, he remarked,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hit again, Mr. Gilmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a moment later another ball grazed the side of his head and cut
a painful wound in his scalp. &ldquo;Mr. Gilmore, they&rsquo;ve hit me
again,&rdquo; he muttered, while he kept on working at the gun, with
blood running down all over him.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a fourth ball passed through the lad&rsquo;s ankle,
one of the most painful parts of the body in which to get shot. This
time, with a slight tremble in his voice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>he said, &ldquo;Mr.
Gilmore, I&rsquo;m hit once more; but I&rsquo;ve fixed your gun,
Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this moment the Filipinos saw that the Americans&rsquo; fire
had practically ceased. Throwing back from off their trench the limbs
and underbrush that had concealed them, the Filipinos, armed with guns,
spears, bolos and clubs, made a bold dash for the boat and captured the
entire crew.</p>

<p class="first">Those of the Americans who were alive and able to help
themselves were ordered to go ashore on the sand bar, where the
Filipinos robbed them of their personal effects and then lined them up
preparatory to shooting them all down in a body. Gilmore, being an
officer, protested against having his hands tied. He claimed, according
to the accepted rules of warfare, that on account of his rank he had a
right to die honorably with his hands free. The Filipinos have great
superstitions about &ldquo;rank&rdquo; in military affairs. Marie knew
the significance of Gilmore&rsquo;s request; she respected it.</p>
<p>The Filipinos had loaded their rifles, cocked them, raised the same
to their shoulders, had taken aim, and Marie was about to give the
fatal command, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;, when a shout from the bank stopped
her and for a moment engaged the attention of both the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>Americans and the Filipinos. It came from a
Filipino officer, running down to the shore. He ordered them to stop.
One second longer would have been too late.</p>
<p>This Tagalo officer ordered the Americans to get back into their
boat and to row across to the opposite shore. After bailing the water
out of the boat and plugging up the holes in it made by the
enemy&rsquo;s rifle balls, they obeyed his command.</p>
<p>When they went ashore, Lieutenant Gilmore asked permission to bury
his dead comrades. This privilege was emphatically denied. What was
done with their bodies by the Filipinos is hard to tell, but in all
probability, as was customary with the natives, they cut them into
fragments and threw them away.</p>
<p>The ones who were mortally wounded, but who were still alive, were
placed under a tree by Gilmore and his comrades, and left to die. The
Lieutenant asked that a native doctor be summoned to give them aid, but
it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>was not done. What their fate was Eternity alone
will reveal.</p>
<p>Gilmore and his comrades picked up the lesser wounded and carried
them, and together the whole procession was marched inland about a mile
to the Filipino Commandante&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>
<p>Here they were questioned at length. Gilmore asked permission to
write a note to the commander of the Yorktown telling him of their
fate. Permission was granted, but the note was never delivered. The two
scouts who went ashore, returned to the Yorktown in the afternoon and
reported that they had heard heavy firing up the river.</p>
<p>After waiting several days for news of some kind for them, and
finally concluding that they were either captured or killed, the crew
of the Yorktown, heavy-hearted over their failure and their sacrifice,
steamed back to Manila.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the same day that the battle took place, the
American prisoners <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>were ordered to march to an old bamboo
church in the northern outskirts of the little town of Baler, a mile
and a half farther on. By this time the wounded men were suffering
terribly. Little Venville&rsquo;s ankle had swollen badly. From his
four wounds he had bled so much that he had grown faint. Therefore, he
and several of the others had to be carried.</p>
<p>En route to their new destination, the Americans passed in sight of
the old stone church being used as a fortress by the Spanish garrison
whom they had originally set out to relieve. The Americans had gone to
the Philippines to fight the Spaniards. They were now sacrificing their
lives to save them.</p>
<p>At the bamboo church, an old Filipino with a kindly face and a
manner that elevated him above his fellow tribesmen, came in to see
them. He examined the wounded and then disappeared. Presently he
returned with some large leaves that resembled rhubarb, under his arm.
Out of the big stems of these native herbs he squeezed a milky
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>secretion which he permitted to drop into the
gaping wounds of the Americans. The torture of the wounded occasioned
by this liquid was damnable. The men grew deathly pale. They rolled and
screamed and begged to be shot. But it did not last long. In ten
minutes the torture had ceased, the men became quiet, the swelling
around their wounds was gradually reduced, and their temperatures soon
lowered. The herb doctor evidently knew his business.</p>
<p>The next day the Filipinos received orders from Aguinaldo, who, with
his appointed congress, was now at San Isidro, to march the captured
Americans to his headquarters. Accordingly, the trip was undertaken.
But the apprentice lad, Venville, was unable to go along. Obeying the
stubborn orders of the rapacious Filipinos his comrades left him lying
on the floor of the old rickety bamboo
church,&mdash;wounded&mdash;uncared
for&mdash;suffering&mdash;hungry&mdash;thirsty&mdash;dying. A year
later the assistance of the entire naval organization in the
Philippines was given to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>the task of trying to ascertain
from the Filipinos in the neighborhood of Baler some information
concerning the lad&rsquo;s whereabouts or his burial place, but no
trace of him, dead or alive, could ever be found.</p>

<p class="line xd20e191">Refuse to bring the joy.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Amid great privations the marching column crossed the
mountains and the fertile plains on the opposite side, to the city of
San Isidro. It was heralded in advance that the Americans were coming
through the country. Obeying their greatest national
instinct&mdash;curiosity&mdash;the natives assembled by thousands in
the villages along the road. Every one of them kept crowding forward to
get to touch the Americans to see what their skins felt like. Others
were looking for the long feathers in their hair, which they had heard
so much about. It was all the Filipino guards could do to restrain
their own people. The latter, like monkeys, jabbered incessantly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>Gilmore&rsquo;s men hurled back at them defiant
epithets. They realized that involuntarily they had become the chief
actors in a new moving circus.</p>
<p>Again, when they reached San Isidro, a great throng of curious
natives had come to town to see them. These fellows were very hostile
to the Americans. It was all the native guard could do to keep the
Filipinos from doing violence to them. Gilmore was again questioned at
length and then he was separated from his comrades and all were hurried
off to jail.</p>
<p>In a few days it was rumored that the American army was approaching
the city. Aguinaldo and his associates hurriedly prepared to leave.
Orders were given to march the prisoners overland north and then
westward across another range of high mountains to Arancay, on the
western coast of Luzon,&mdash;a distance of 100 miles.</p>
<p>This time the crowd of prisoners was greatly increased. At San
Isidro there were added 600 Spaniards; a small tribe of mountain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>Negritos whom Aguinaldo had originally sent to
fight the Americans, but who, being armed only with spears and bolos,
soon got tired of seeing their number decrease so rapidly before
American riflemen, and refused to fight, and who were later imprisoned
and terribly misused by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s selected guards; and eighteen
Americans in addition to Gilmore&rsquo;s party (total twenty-six
Americans), who had been captured in as many different ways around
Manila by the crafty, cunning Filipinos. Among them was Frank Stone, of
the U. S. Signal Corps, captured by some &ldquo;amigos&rdquo; (friendly
natives) on the railroad track near Manila, while out strolling one
Sunday afternoon; Private Curran, of the 16th U.S. Infantry who was
grabbed within fifty feet of his own outpost, gagged and dragged into
captivity; also a civilian who had gone to the Philippines to sell
liquor.</p>
<p>This fellow was captured by the Filipinos in the outskirts of Manila
while he was searching for a small boatload of stolen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>beer. He was the life of the expedition. He took
his captivity as a joke, told stories to keep the prisoners good
natured, and painted on ever boulder that he passed the seemingly
sacrilegious words, &ldquo;Drink Blank&rsquo;s beer on the road to
H&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; It was, however, this harmless practice that
later on enabled the American relief party to follow the
prisoners&rsquo; trail.</p>
<p>After reaching the western shore of Luzon, the party was marched
northward along the beach, another 100 miles, to the city of Vigan.
Here they were imprisoned for three months longer. The sudden presence
of an American war-ship in the harbor, off Vigan, caused the natives to
abandon that city and start inland with their prisoners for some
mountain fastness. The Americans were separated from the rest of the
prisoners whom they never saw again.</p>
<p>High up in the mountains of northern Luzon, two of the American boys
were taken sick with fever and fell down, exhausted. The Filipino
lieutenant who had charge of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>prisoners, ordered them to go
on; they could not. He threatened to shoot them. Gilmore interceded for
them without avail. The Americans refused to leave their Anglo-Saxon
comrades and prepared to fight. At this moment the Filipino officer
himself was suddenly taken ill, and by the time he was able to advance,
the sick Americans were able to go along.</p>
<p>A few days later they struggled over the crest of the divide and
came upon the headwaters of a beautiful mountain torrent dancing down
the rocky ledges in its onward course to the sea. At a widened place in
the canon, the Filipinos withdrew from the Americans, and with guns in
hand took their positions on the rocks round-about and above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare to die,&rdquo; said Gilmore to his companions;
&ldquo;they are going to shoot us.&rdquo; Calling the Filipino
lieutenant to his side Gilmore asked him why he did not shoot them on
the opposite side of the mountains, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>and not have made
them make all of that hard climb for nothing.</p>
<p>The native officer said in reply: &ldquo;My orders were to shoot all
of you when I got you up in the mountains, where, in all probability,
your bodies would be destroyed by wild animals and no trace of them
ever be found by your countrymen; but a few nights ago when you showed
me that crucifix tattooed on your chest while you were a midshipman in
America, I decided not to carry out my order, but to let you all go
free. I may be punished for disobedience of orders; but we are both
bound together by the great Catholic church, and my conscience forbids
that I should kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilmore replied: &ldquo;You might as well shoot us as to set us free
away up here in the mountains in our weakened condition with nothing to
defend ourselves with against the savages whose territory we will have
to cross in order to get to the sea. Can&rsquo;t you spare us at least
two rifles and some ammunition? If you will do this, I will give
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>you a letter which, should you fall into the
hands of the Americans, will make you safe and bring you ample
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Filipino looked meditatingly at the ground for several moments,
then he calmly said, &ldquo;I shall not dare to do it. An American
relief party, seeking your liberation, is close on our heels. They will
protect and care for you. Goodby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilmore did not believe him.</p>
<p>Under cover of the night the Filipinos disappeared. In the morning,
after nine long, tedious months of captivity resulting from Marie
Sampalit&rsquo;s depredations,&mdash;sick, nearly starved, practically
nude, with nothing but two battle axes and a bolo for both weapons of
defense and for tools&mdash;the Americans at last found themselves free
men in the wilds of northern Luzon, with positive death left behind,
and with possible life and all of its happy associations still before
them.</p>

</div>
<p>Their first day of liberty was spent in preparing bamboo rafts on
which to float down the tortuous, winding river to the sea.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>The next night they all slept well; and on the
following morning, just after they had gotten up and begun to saunter
around, everybody present was suddenly shocked by the shrill yell of a
strong American voice. They all looked up, and while their hearts for a
moment seemingly stopped beating and fairly rose in their throats, the
liberated prisoners beheld the blue shirts and khaki trousers of
Colonel Hare&rsquo;s rescue party that for several weeks had been on
their trail.</p>
<p>What rejoicing! The bony, ill-clad prisoners fell on the strong
bosoms of their rescuers and wept.</p>
<p>Colonel Hare&rsquo;s father, Judge Hare, of Washington, D.C., knew
Gilmore personally. He had seen the military reports of his captivity
among the natives. When his son bade him goodby as he started for the
Philippines, Judge Hare said, &ldquo;My boy, God bless you; find
Gilmore and bring him home!&rdquo; Colonel Hare had remained true to
his trust.</p>
<p>The party could not retrace their steps over the mountains, owing to
the weakened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>condition of the prisoners and the lack of food.
Their only chance for self-preservation and a possible return to
civilization lay in carrying out Gilmore&rsquo;s designs to build
bamboo rafts and float down the river to the sea. This was done. In
going over rapids and water-falls, many rafts were destroyed and new
ones had to be built.</p>
<p>Two of the boys got the measles. The raft on which one of them,
Private Day, was being transported, got smashed on the rocks and he was
thrown into the water. He took cold and died the next day. His comrades
took his body with them and did not bury it until they finally reached
the little town of Ambulug, at the mouth of the stream they had been
following, on the northern coast of Luzon. There, amid a simple but
impressive ceremony, it was buried in the church-yard of the cathedral
to await the resurrection morn.</p>
<p>At Ambulug the Americans secured ox-carts drawn by caribous and
drove along the beach to the city of Aparri, at the mouth of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>the Cagayan river. Here they were met by a
detachment of American Marines who took them aboard a war-ship, lying
out to sea, which carried them around the northwest promontory of Luzon
to the city of Vigan on the western coast, at which place they had been
imprisoned for so long.</p>
<p>Here they met General Young who shook hands with each of them;
congratulated the rescued and complimented the rescuers.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the battle of Baler, Marie and a few native
soldiers hastened westward in advance of the prisoners, to San Isidro
to notify Aguinaldo who had moved his headquarters to that place, that
the Americans were advancing northward in great numbers and that
nothing could impede their progress. This information had previously
been conveyed to the Filipino general from other sources, so that Marie
found him in his so-called congress packed up and ready to
move,&mdash;a thing they were forced to do a few days after the
American prisoners arrived. She accompanied them for several long,
tedious months, acting as cook for the expedition and serving in other
capacities&mdash;none of them seeming to her to be ample reward for all
she had done.</p>
<p>Early in the coming fall, Marie, tired of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s game of
hide-and-go-seek, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>anxious to find out about her
mother and to get into more fighting, if there be a chance, made her
way back to Manila.</p>
<p>But her conscience bothered her. She remembered that broken oath and
many other acts of wanton treachery that would shock the civilized
world. She feared that her own life would soon be sought either by the
Americans or by the Filipinos. Accordingly she suggested to her mother
that they again go to her aunt&rsquo;s in the little town of Angono at
the north end of Lake Laguna de Bay, where she had left her mother
stationed when last they had parted. Her mother, growing old and
nervous through accumulated years, past grievances, hard work and the
strain of the present conflict, favored the plan; and so they departed
on December 2nd, taking the same road over McLeod&rsquo;s Hill and on
down over the Santa Mesa bridge that they had traveled on February
4th.</p>
<p>Before leaving Manila she learned through the private Filipino Junta
which was secretly assisting in the war by accumulating <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>funds for its prosecution and by distributing
among the native troops the inflammatory literature which was being
promiscuously sent out by the people in the United States who opposed
the war, that a secret reward of $10,000. had been offered for the
death of General Lawton.</p>
<p>About the middle of December, 1899, the General had returned to
Manila from another telling campaign northward, when he learned that
the Filipinos were assembling in large numbers under one of their
fearless leaders, General Geronemo, on the San Mateo river, but a few
miles out of Manila, for the purpose of making one more attempt to
break through the American lines guarding that city.</p>
<p>On December 17, Marie heard that another attack was to be made on
Manila, so she left her mother at Angono and made her way to the
Filipinos&rsquo; camp along the San Mateo river, only a few miles south
of where she had crossed it at the rapids the morning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>after she had been liberated under oath by Major
Allison.</p>
<p>The next day, she was in secret consultation with Geronemo, and she
disclosed to him all the information she had concerning the defenses of
Manila.</p>
<p>That evening, Filipino scouts, dressed in female attire, brought to
General Geronemo the news that the Americans, under General Lawton, who
was supposed to be away up in the northern part of Luzon, had
anticipated his movements and were assembling in the woods on the
opposite side of the valley in large numbers, possibly for a night
attack.</p>
<p>Marie told Geronemo what she had learned while in Manila concerning
the reward that had been secretly offered for the killing of General
Lawton. He knew all about it and confirmed the offer. She told him all
about her training as a marksman with the Spanish on Corregidor island
and of her subsequent experience, and said she knew General Lawton
well; that she could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span>single him out, and in case he led his
troops, as he usually did in battle, she was sure she could capture the
prize.</p>
<p>A place of unusual safety and concealment was selected along the
Filipinos&rsquo; lines, directly in front of the center of the probable
point of attack by the Americans, for Marie, and for a Filipino
lieutenant and a corporal, both of whom were also good shots.</p>
<p>Geronemo had instructed them that Marie was to have the first three
shots at the general, in case he appeared on the scene of battle. If
she failed to hit him, the lieutenant was then to try it. After he had
taken three shots, if he, too, failed, the corporal was to be given a
chance.</p>
<p>The next morning, December 19, the American line of battle came out
of the woods on the opposite side of the valley, ready to charge on the
Filipinos&rsquo; position. The morning was bright and clear, so that
General Lawton, with his tall figure, resplendent uniform and large
white helmet, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>could easily be discerned by the entire Filipino
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix him,&rdquo; whispered Marie, &ldquo;just wait
till the firing begins, so that I can shoot without attracting
attention to our position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment, the Filipinos opened fire on the Americans all along
the line. The latter sought cover. General Lawton remained erect. He
made an ideal target. Marie took careful aim. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went
her rifle, and at that very moment this peerless leader of men, this
hero of several wars, was shot through the heart and fell dead in the
arms of his aide. His only words were, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that! What did I tell you?&rdquo; snapped out Marie,
&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d get him! Now for my dinero.&rdquo;
(money).</p>
<p>The Americans were so angered because of the sudden death of their
beloved commander that they made a mad rush forward, without orders,
and swept the Filipino army from the field.</p>

<p>Marie returned to Manila where she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>claimed the reward
for having shot the general. The lieutenant who was with her claimed
that he did it, and by promising half of the bounty to the corporal for
swearing to the lie, he proved it. Meager reports of the affair state
that only $7000 of the money was actually paid over. Like Aguinaldo who
crept into a cave northwest of Manila and sold out his country during
the insurrection of 1896, and then could not collect his fee, so Marie,
too, found herself deprived of the compensation for her bloody deed.

<p class="first">The controversy over the distribution of the fund in
Manila for the death in any form of General Lawton permitted the unholy
scheme to simmer its way into publicity. The United States authorities
employed secret detectives to investigate the matter and if possible to
locate the persons who claimed to be responsible for the act. Marie
soon found herself under surveillance and she quickly left the
city.</p>
<p>Making her way north on horse back along the same route she had
taken when on her way to Baler about a year before, she came to the
city of San Miguel where one of the hardest battles of the war had been
fought. The troops engaged in this fight had become so disorganized
that all formation by regiments, companies, etc., had been broken up.
Unfortunately, one of the Americans&rsquo; dead privates could not be
identified. He was buried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>where he fell, and a board
tombstone was placed at the head of his grave, on which was carved this
lonely word,</p>
<p class="xd20e144">&ldquo;UNKNOWN&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As Marie passed over the old field, she saw this grave and read the
solemn word on its headstone. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she muttered,
&ldquo;I wonder if the same sad fate will some day overtake
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of this &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; soldier was exhumed by the
government a few months later and brought back to the United States for
burial. Upon its arrival the following pathetic poem appeared in
&ldquo;Leslie&rsquo;s Weekly&rdquo;;</p>

<p>Her personal safety demanded that she continue her journey
northward, without delay; also her inclination to rejoin Aguinaldo and
his troops&mdash;although his exact whereabouts were
unknown&mdash;invited her in this direction.</p>
<p>At San Isidro, from which place Aguinaldo had been driven, she saw
some American soldiers administering the water cure to some Filipinos
in order to make them reveal the whereabouts of their wily general.
Marie was angry. She yearned to shoot, but she was no longer on the
aggressive; she was now a fugitive from justice. At this place she
inspected the old Filipino prison and on its walls found the names of
Gilmore and his party, whom she had helped to capture at Baler, who had
been imprisoned there, and who were still alive when Aguinaldo was
driven from the city of San Isidro by the approach of the Americans.
She determined to take her revenge on them for this water cure
punishment, if she ever found them. But the opportunity never came.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>So journeying on toward the northern part of
Luzon she had many experiences, and she came in contact with tribes
whom she had never seen before and whose dialect was foreign to her.
Many things combined to retard her progress. Often she grew very weary
and would have turned back, except for fear.</p>
<p>Following up the valley of the Pampanga river and thence on
northward along the Barat, she passed through the province of Nueva
Ecija, crossed the Caraballo mountains which form its northern
boundary, and then entered the province of Nueva Vizcaya, where she
came upon the head-waters of the Rio Magat river.</p>
<p>In crossing the Caraballo mountains she made her way through a deep
gorge at night. It was now about the middle of February. A full moon
shone at its best. The weather was ideal. Journeying was abnormally
pleasant. Under favorable conditions, during times of peace, the trip
she was taking would have been a delightful outing. Just <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>now
things were different. Small garrisons of American soldiers had crowded
forward and were occupying the largest cities along her route. As yet
she had not gotten beyond them. &ldquo;A guilty conscience needs no
accuser&rdquo;; everywhere that she went she imagined herself to be
under suspicion.</p>
<p>Far up in the Caraballos she came across a little mountain torrent
which leaped down over the mountain side from one rocky ledge to
another at quite regular intervals in a series of waterfalls until it
beat itself into a turbulent spray in the bed of the chasm below. The
laughing moon filtered its beaming rays through the thin sheet of
shimmering water as it danced down its course from precipice to
precipice, and seemingly converted it into a great silvery stair-way
connecting earth with heaven. Marie&rsquo;s heart throbbed with
emotion. The dashing of the falling water on the rocks below in the bed
of the canon made a hollow sound as its echoes reverberated through the
gorge above.</p>
<p>A half mile farther up, the valley widened <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>somewhat; and finding here some grass for her
pony to forage on, she stopped for the night. The flimsy saddle was
removed from her horse and converted into a crude pillow, in true
cowboy style. Marie was uneasy. This was the first night in all her
adventures that she had been absolutely alone, separated from both
friends and foes, with no house to shelter her weary head, with the
cloudless canopy of the silent heavens arched above her, the silvery
moonbeams dancing in her face, and with no voice, save the echoes of
her own, to answer back the whispers of night.</p>
<p>It is often only in such a silent nook as this, with no one present
but God and self, that humanity asserts itself and the tenderest
portions of the human soul become paramount and give rise to sacred
thoughts. Even the savage cannot escape it, for he, too, feels his
responsibility to something outside of self. No doubt the
self-conscious criminal would be the most susceptible to it.</p>
<p>What a night for Marie! Solitude gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>rise to fear; fear,
to conscious criminality; a sense of wrong-doing, to grief. Would
morning never come? Every time she fell into a doze her sleep was
disturbed by dreams of the past. Recollections of her dying benefactor
in the woods by the San Mateo river, of Gilmore&rsquo;s comrades
bleeding by his side, and of Lawton in the arms of his aide, filled her
soul with remorse and suggested to her with an unspeakable vividness
that in all probability she would pay the penalty on both sides of the
grave. Awakening from one awful dream, she would, after listening to
the stillness of the night for a time, lapse into another. Again she
would suddenly awake and begin to fumble her rosary and repeat
selections from a Catholic prayer book. Would she dare to turn back?
Behind her was certain death; before her, the possibility of life. She
resolved to go on.</p>
<p>The night whiled away. Her pony ate his fill and lay down to rest.
Beaded dew drops collected themselves in close proximity upon the
grasses and foliage about her feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>The cool mountain air
from without and fear from within caused her to shiver a great deal.
Day finally came; Marie rode on.</p>
<p>Following the Magat river she finally reached the city of Bayombong
with a population of 20,000 people. Here she learned from the natives
that Aguinaldo and a loyal remnant of his appointed congress had passed
through the city ahead of her, en route northward.</p>
<p>At Bayombong she was advised to follow down the Magat river for
twenty miles, then to bear to the northeast along the pathway made by
Aguinaldo and his followers in their recent retreat. This she did,
crossing another range of mountains near Fort Del Pilar, which had been
erected by the Filipinos to circumvent as well as to prevent the
progress of the Americans, should they attempt to follow them. On the
farther side of this slope she came upon the headwaters of the Rio
Grande de Cagayan river, which she followed on to the north for several
weeks, enjoying the hospitality of the natives <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>along the course, until at last she came upon
the beautiful city of Ilagan at the confluence of the Cagayan and
Pinacanalan rivers.</p>
<p>It was now late in April. Marie was tired and needed rest. At Ilagan
she was cordially received by the curious natives who were eager to
learn some news concerning the war which was being conducted several
hundred miles further south. Marie grew cheerful. There were no
Americans in the city, and nobody knew of any within the valley. She
felt that at last she had successfully eluded her supposed pursuers and
that she was safe. Ilagan is the capital of Isabella province. It has a
population of approximately 60,000 people. Marie&rsquo;s natural
ability, information gathered in the school of experience, knowledge of
the details of the war, and her willingness to talk (quite a number at
Ilagan could speak Spanish) made of her a sort of responsive idol for
the entire populace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">She remained at Ilagan until the middle of June, when
it began to be rumored that the Americans were preparing to invade the
Cagayan valley, not only soldiers from the south but with the
&ldquo;mosquito fleet&rdquo; coming up the river from its mouth at the
extreme northern end of the island of Luzon. Nobody in the city seemed
to know just where Aguinaldo had gone. Part of his advance guard had
arrived in the city some three months before, but he had not come, and
his soldiers had soon departed for the southeast, following the valley
of the Pinacanalan river.</p>
<p>Tired of her surroundings and impatient to join Aguinaldo, Marie
departed by the same route that his soldiers had taken. From an old
native living all alone in a bamboo shack on the bank of the Rio
Masagan river, which empties into the Pinacanalan about eighteen miles
southeast of Ilagan, she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>learned that Aguinaldo and his
troops had started up the valley of the Masagan. This stream rises high
up near the summit of the Sierra Madre mountains which parallel the
eastern coast of northern Luzon for nearly five hundred miles, and are
inland from the coast from ten to thirty miles.</p>
<p>Marie had with her three trusted natives from Ilagan. She did not
want to spend another night alone in the mountains. After proceeding up
the Masagan for thirty-five miles to a place where its valley narrows
itself to a gorge, its bed was so strewn with huge boulders that it
became impossible to travel any longer on horseback; therefore, one of
the natives was sent back with the horses, and Marie and the two others
continued the ascent on foot, taking with them such equipment and
provisions as they could conveniently carry.</p>
<p>After many hardships they succeeded in crossing the range in safety
and soon found themselves descending the other side. A Filipino
scouting party was met at the evening <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>of the first
day&rsquo;s tramp down the Pacific slope. They were well supplied with
food&mdash;thing Marie and her companions greatly needed. From them it
was learned that Aguinaldo and his body guard and quite a complement of
Filipino soldiers were secreted at the little town of Palanan on a
small stream by the same name, about ten miles back from the coast and
lying directly east of them on the journey which they were pursuing.
This party escorted them to Filipino headquarters, which they reached
July 10, 1900.</p>
<p>Marie was cordially welcomed by Aguinaldo, who restored her to a
position on his staff and secured from her the identical information
which he desired relative to the movement of the American troops, and
the very information, strange to say, which led to his own discovery
and capture by General Funston of the American forces in March of the
following year.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo learned from Marie that from the Filipinos&rsquo;
standpoint, the war around <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>Manila had been a dismal failure.
He decided, therefore, to send one of his trusted generals south by
practically the same route over which Marie had come, with information
to the Filipino troops east and south of Manila to move all their
available forces north with the quickest possible despatch and to place
them under his immediate command so that he might not only render
himself immune from capture, but take the initiative and oppose the
American campaign in the valley of the Cagayan river.</p>
<p>In December, 1900, about three months before his capture by General
Funston, Aguinaldo, having learned that the Americans were making their
way in great numbers into the valley of the Cagayan, asked Marie to
take up duty as a spy again; to recross the Sierra Madre mountains;
visit the American lines; ascertain their number of soldiers on duty in
the valley on the opposite side of the mountains and then to bring this
information to him, so that when reinforcements <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>should arrive he would know better how to
undertake the campaign.</p>
<p>To this, Marie willingly assented, but she insisted that she could
not make the trip alone over the rugged Sierra Madre mountains; that
she had nearly famished crossing them the first time. Aguinaldo
therefor fitted out a little expedition consisting of eight Filipinos,
in addition to Marie, and a pack-train of fourteen ponies to accompany
her over the divide. Nine of the animals were for riding purposes; the
other five were to pack the supplies,&mdash;three of them for the
outward trip, two for the incoming. In addition to the rice which they
took along, they were instructed to forage as much as possible.</p>
<p>On December 9, the party started out on their perilous undertaking.
A point far up on the mountain slope, near a refreshing mineral spring,
having been reached on December 17, the party halted and established a
sub-base for their return trip. It was evident to them that they had
struck the wrong <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>trail and were going to be compelled to
send Marie back through a different gorge from the one by which she and
her associates had come over a few months before.</p>
<p>Here the party divided into two relays&mdash;one to accompany Marie
close to the top of the mountains, the other to remain where it was
until her guides returned. At this temporary base three Filipinos and
two pack-horses were left. The Filipinos thus left behind were
instructed to hunt and trap all they could till their comrades
returned.</p>
<p>The on-going squad, consisting of Marie and five native soldiers,
took with them their six riding ponies and three of the pack-horses.
They departed from their comrades early in the morning, December 18. By
night of the second day they had gotten so near the crest they could
plainly discern that in one long march Marie could cross the divide and
get a safe distance down the slope on the opposite side. Coming to an
old stone church they dismounted and established themselves for the
night. It was December <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>19,&mdash;the anniversary of
Lawton&rsquo;s death. Marie remarked about it.</p>
<p>This old church had partly fallen down. Vines and mosses had so
interlaced themselves in climbing over its rocky walls and across its
openings that they had to be cut away by the unwelcome intruders before
they could gain an entrance. The stone cross on the front gable was
still in place; but the old mahogany door had long since been torn from
its hinges by the mountain storms, and it lay in a state of decay on
the ground. An earthquake had destroyed part of the roof, and had
caused the west wall to become inclined and to crumble.</p>
<p>Within, one end of the old altar was still found to be intact. The
priest&rsquo;s pulpit chair had become ivy-mantled, and one handle had
rotted from its fastenings and had fallen to the floor. Statues of the
Saints had pitched from their moorings in the alcoves along the walls
and were lying face-downward or standing on their heads amid the debris
below. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>What hands had built this old church, none could tell. It seemed
certain that no human being had entered it for over a century. The
mountain tribes who had lifted into place the huge chalk stones that
composed its massive walls, under the devout leadership of some pious
monk, for a place of worship, had long since perished from the earth.
The mountain game which rendered possible their habitation in this
altitude had vanished. Everything and everybody had evidently given way
before some fierce invasion of one of their southern tribes.</p>
<p>Marie was busy cleaning off the trash from the massive rock that lay
at the entrance to the door-way. &ldquo;1765,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;come, see the date chiseled in the rock! I wonder what has
become of the tribe that built it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soldier who had made his entrance by one of the window openings,
was busily engaged in prying up a huge flat stone just back of the
altar. He had it loosened; he called for help to remove it. When the
stone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>had been overturned and had fallen back onto its
aged neighbors, some soft damp earth beneath it was slowly scraped
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the native who on bended knees was doing
the sacrilegious work, &ldquo;Did you hear that grating
noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scraped again with his bolo turned edgewise, and gripping the
back of it firmly with both hands. &ldquo;Do you hear it?&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes a metallic box was pried out of the earth wherein
it had lain unmolested for many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you read the inscription on it?&rdquo; asked Marie.</p>
<p>Carefully the sediment and rust shales were removed. The grooves in
the letters and figures of the inscription were carefully cleaned out
with a knife. It read</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first xd20e144">FATHER<br>
JUADANEZ<br>
1768.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old father has been dead a long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>time,&rdquo; said the fellow who was doing the
details of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;if we really ought to
disturb his bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they put any valuables in the little chest
when they sealed it up?&rdquo; asked another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has always been customary to put in the sacred urn,&rdquo;
said Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it open!&rdquo; commanded a corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the robber; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
have to build a fire and melt it open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did; and in it they found the dust of his bones and a
number of valuables including the Patricia&rsquo;s gold-lined cup which
Marie took and hung on her belt.</p>
<p>That night a terrible storm swept over the mountains. Marie and her
companions crept into the old church for refuge. The ponies had been
given some rice and then set free to forage as best they could. They
were stampeded by the violence of the wind and rain.</p>
<p>The morning broke cool and clear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>Everybody was astir
at day-break. The ponies were gone, but plenty of rice remained. Marie
soon saw a way out of the difficulty. She left three of her men at the
old church to await the return of the two who were to accompany her
until she reached some plan for speedy descent on the opposite side of
the mountains.</p>
<p>The advance party started out early on foot, taking with them such a
supply of rice and bananas as they could carry. Only three miles
farther up they entered a canon whose rocky walls, at places almost
perpendicular and seeming to form pillars for the sky, were so close
together at their base that it would have been impossible to have used
the ponies for travel, even though they had not retreated in the
storm.</p>
<p>Good progress was made, and by sun-down, December 20, they had
reached the upper rivulets of what afterwards proved to be the north
fork of the Rio Masagan, instead of the south fork which she had
previously followed. The beautiful valleys below <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>them
were plainly visible as the sun sank to rest over the distant hills. A
small native village could be seen on the bank of the stream a few
miles ahead. The party bivouacked for the night.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, after a light lunch of cold rice, Marie was
off on her important mission.</p>
<p>Her two escorts made their way back to the old church, where after
another night&rsquo;s rest, the five undertook their return journey to
the sub-base at the spring far down the mountain side. When they
reached this camp they found their ponies all returned to it; and their
comrades, thinking they had all been captured or slain by the
Americans, were hastily preparing to retreat. The entire party, except
Marie, got back to Aguinaldo&rsquo;s camp at Palanan, on Christmas
Day.</p>
<p>Marie, was therefore, left to arrange for her own return, after her
spy work had been completed. She contemplated securing help from the
natives at Ilagan, among whom she had previously lived for a few
months. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=

<p class="first">On the evening of December 24, 1900,&mdash;one of
those dark nights in the Philippines when the air seems so dense that
you can almost take hold of it with your hands&mdash;when the heavy
clouds blanket the earth so closely that the terrible thunders seem to
shake the earth in its orbit, with the deep-toned diapason of their
melody&mdash;when the lightening bugs flutter from twig to twig,
revealing their lanterned wings&mdash;when the human heart beats with a
conscious thump in anticipation of something awful&mdash;when those who
are out alone whistle to give themselves courage&mdash;when the zigzag
openings rent through the clouds by the vicious lightning flashes
almost reveal Eternity;&mdash;Christmas Eve, that sacred occasion which
we all celebrate and shall continue to celebrate till the end of time,
to commemorate the birth of our Christ,&mdash;a sharp-eyed, dare-devil
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>Filipino crept slowly out of the city of Ilagan
along a foot-path toward the Americans&rsquo; camp about a mile north
of that city.</p>
<p>When so near to the Americans that their out-posts were plainly
visible during the flashes of lightning, the Filipino spy crept into a
bamboo thicket not over fifty feet from an American sentry. After lying
there for a half hour, waiting for the storm to come, the native grew a
trifle bolder and arose to his knees. That moment the sharp eyes of the
sentry caught him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal of the Guard!&rdquo; called the sentry in a loud
voice.</p>
<p>The corporal, being suspicious that something unusual was taking
place, in responding to the call took with him two armed privates.</p>
<p>Approaching the sentry, with light steps and in a crouching
attitude, the corporal said in a heavy whisper, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentry was standing with gun in hand, loaded, cocked, and with
bayonet fixed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>Keeping his eye centered on the exact spot where
he had last seen the slowly gravitating figure before him, the guard
said in an undertone that denoted grave alarm, &ldquo;Do you see that
thicket just to the left of that big mango tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; said the corporal in a whisper,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man in there,&rdquo; said the sentry.
&ldquo;I saw him quite plainly at first&mdash;and I think he&rsquo;s
got a gun in his hand. You better watch out, boys. He&rsquo;s still
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal and the two privates fixed the bayonets on their
Krag-Jorgensons, filled the magazines, slipped a shell into the barrel
of each rifle, cocked them, crouched close to the ground, some ten feet
apart, and began to move forward, a step at a time, between the flashes
of lightening. Each time it would flash, they would peer into the
thicket. Each step brought them nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he lies!,&rdquo; said one of the privates in a quick
out-spoken voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amigo,&rdquo; (a friend) said the stretched-out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>form, as three guns were raised in unison with
the anxious muzzles pointing directly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Este no quere combate&rdquo; (you don&rsquo;t desire to
fight), said the corporal, in crude Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mucho amigo&rdquo; (very friendly), came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vamose aque!&rdquo; (come here), commanded the corporal.</p>
<p>With his eyes fixed in theirs, the Filipino raised himself slowly up
and came toward the three Americans who stood but twelve feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him by the arms,&rdquo; said the corporal to the two
privates who were with him, &ldquo;while I look behind that rice-dyke
to see if he had a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what the rascal was up to,&rdquo; said the
corporal, holding a Mauser above his head. &ldquo;Good thing you saw
him when you did, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storm was coming nearer; the first gust of wind had just struck
them. It blew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>back the Filipino&rsquo;s little checkered
frock. The corporal saw a glitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out! boys, he&rsquo;s got a machete under his
coat,&rdquo; said the corporal.</p>
<p>He was searched for more weapons and then marched inside the
American lines and taken directly to headquarters. A drum-head court
was convened at once and the prisoner led in.</p>
<p>With hands clinched, muscles taut, eyes piercing at the court, he
listened to the reading of the charge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught acting as a spy for the enemy in violation of the
Articles of War; armed, with intent to take the life of an American
sentry on guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the testimony had been taken, the prisoner was given a chance
to speak, but he absolutely refused to do so, even though addressed in
several different languages and dialects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spoke Spanish to us as we captured him,&rdquo; interjected
the corporal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;GUILTY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>said the lieutenant-colonel who was presiding, in a firm military
tone. &ldquo;The court fixes the penalty at death, and sentences the
prisoner to be shot at sun-rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove him, Sergeant, and detail a firing squad to execute
the order of the court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the prisoner was led away, the lieutenant-colonel dropped his
chin in the palms of his hands as he rested his elbows on his knees,
and muttered in a semi-regretful way: &ldquo;I hate to do it; but in
the past we have always been so chicken-hearted about punishing these
blood-thirsty natives that they have now come to regard our kindness as
cowardice. I can&rsquo;t help but feel that it will bring the war to a
close quicker if we deal with them hereafter with a good firm
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what province the young fellow came from,&rdquo;
said a major who was sitting near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the
lieutenant-colonel: &ldquo;his face shows him to be a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>Tagalo. Certain it is that he didn&rsquo;t come
from Isabella province in which we are now campaigning. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Aguinaldo were near here and if he had
sent this young dare-devil to cut down our sentry, so as to make an
attack upon us tonight during the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward morning the storm subsided. At day-break a comparatively
shallow grave was hastily dug near the edge of a little bamboo thicket
on a slightly elevated piece of ground. As the flickering rays of the
tropical sun began to shoot above the pale, ashen-gray hue of the
eastern horizon, the prisoner was led to the foot of his prospective
tomb. The firing squad took its place in line.</p>
<p>The guns had been carefully loaded in advance for their deadly work;
all but one contained blank cartridges. As usual, after loading, the
guns were intermixed, so that no man might know which one contained the
deadly bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; commanded the sergeant who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>had
charge of the squad,&mdash;the corporal having taken his usual place in
line with his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Click,&rdquo; went the hammers of the rifles in unison, as
they were brought to a full cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aim!&rdquo; came the next command in a firmer tone. The
soldiers brought their rifles to their shoulders. Every barrel was
pointed at the chest of the prisoner, who now for the first time, began
to tremble and turn a sickly yellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; commanded the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went the united roar of the guns; and as the
light powder smoke cleared away and the echoes reverberated through the
woods of northern Luzon, the firing squad stepped forward to view their
heroic dead.</p>
<p>A private jumped into the grave and turned the corpse over onto its
back.</p>
<p>That night Frank W. Pugh, of the regular army, a member of this
unfortunate firing squad, who died later at Fort Worth, Texas, of fever
contracted in the Philippines, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>sitting in his little
dog-tent, meditating, wrote in his diary, which is now preserved in the
archives at Washington with other relics of the war, the following
appropriate poem:</p>
